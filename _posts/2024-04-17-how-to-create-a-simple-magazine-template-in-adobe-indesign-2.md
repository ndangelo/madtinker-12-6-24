Ever wanted to create your own magazine? In this tutorial, suitable for beginner or intermediate InDesign users, we’ll create a blank magazine page template. It’ll be all set for you to come back to again and again in your own magazine design projects.

## What You’ll Learn in This Magazine Article Template Tutorial

## 1. How to Create Your Magazine Cover Template in InDesign

Here’s the first tip to learn how to make a magazine template in InDesign:

It’s much easier to split your InDesign magazine template into **two separate documents**—a cover (including the front and back of the cover, plus a spine) and the inside pages.

As you would have to export these separately for printing anyway, this is a good first step to help you feel organized and in control of your magazine as you design.

Let’s create the magazine cover template first.

### Step 1

Open up **Adobe InDesign** and go to **File &gt; New &gt; Document.**

In the **New Document** window that opens, keep the **Intent** set to **Print**. Set the **Number of Pages** to **1** and deselect **Facing Pages**.

Under **Page Size,** choose **US Magazine\***, and keep the **Orientation** set to **Portrait**.

Set the **Margins** on all sides to an equal width—here I’ve gone for **13 mm**. Finally, add a **Bleed** of **5 mm** on all sides of the page.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![new document](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/1.1.jpg)</figure></div>Click **OK** to create the magazine template in InDesign.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![new document](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/1.1.1.jpg)</figure></div>***\* A note on page sizing***—Magazines come in a range of sizes, and these sizes will vary depending on the type of magazine you are publishing and where you are publishing it. Look up standard magazine sizes for your country online. This will give you a good idea of what is normal for printers producing magazines in bulk and also what is acceptable for retailers stocking magazines. However, if you’re creating a magazine for a more local audience, e.g. a college magazine or a shop lookbook, you can be more flexible with sizing.

### Step 2

Expand the **Pages** panel **(Window &gt; Pages)**, which is docked to the right side of your workspace. This page, **Page 1,** will form the front of our cover.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![front of cover](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/1.2.jpg)</figure></div>In the **Pages** panel, click and drag the **Page 1** icon onto the **Create New Page** button at the bottom of the panel, to duplicate the page. This will be the reverse side of your cover.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![back of cover](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/1.2.1.jpg)</figure></div>Advertisement

### Step 3

From the **Pages** panel’s drop-down menu, click on **Allow Document Pages to Shuffle**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![shuffle pages](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/1.3.jpg)</figure></div>Grab **Page 2** (the back of your cover) in the **Pages** panel and drag it up to the left side of **Page 1**, dropping it into place when you see a black bracket appear (**\[**).

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![shifting pages](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/1.3.1.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 4

With your cursor still placed on the back cover page (which is now **Page 1**), click on the **Create New Page** button at the bottom of the panel.

This will insert a new page directly into the middle of the spread. This page will be the spine of your cover. By creating it as a separate page, you can easily change the width to suit the number of pages in your issue.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![create new page](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/1.4.jpg)</figure></div>To do this, select the **Page Tool (Shift-P)** from the **Tools** panel and click once onto the central page to select it.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![page tool](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/1.4.1.jpg)</figure></div>To make the spine width quite narrow, you’ll probably have to reduce the margin size of this page to allow InDesign to compress the page. Go to **Layout &gt; Margins and Columns**, and from here reduce the **Margins** to something like **1** or **2 mm**. Click **OK**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![margins](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/1.4.2.jpg)</figure></div>Then, from the **Controls** panel at the top of the screen, set the new **Width** of the page. Here, I’ve set it to **10 mm**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![spine width](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/1.4.3.jpg)</figure></div><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![final cover template](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/1.4.4.jpg)</figure></div>You’ve now got an easy-to-edit cover template, ready for embellishing with your own designs.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![edited cover](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/1.4.5.jpg)</figure></div>Awesome work! Let’s take a look at how to set up the inside pages of your InDesign magazine template.

## 2. How to Set Up the Inside Pages of Your Magazine

Now that you’ve got your magazine cover template prepared, you can move on to setting up magazine page templates for your project. This takes a little more time, but once you’ve finished it, you’ll have a flexible magazine article template which is super easy to adapt to different magazine genres.

### Step 1

Go to **File &gt; New &gt; Document** in **InDesign** and, as before, set the **Intent** to **Print**.

For now, set the **Number of Pages** to an even number—here I’ve opted for **16** pages. This will create an opening right-hand page and closing left-hand page for your INDD magazine template, but you can easily add or subtract spreads later as you work on your design. Make sure that **Facing Pages** remains checked.

For **Page Size**, set the **Width** and **Height** to match the dimensions you set for your cover. Here, I’ve chosen **US Magazine** from the drop-down menu.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![US magazine size](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/2.1.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

It’s very important to set appropriate margins for your InDesign magazine templates. If the way in which your magazine is to be bound will allow the reader to open it fully, with all elements across the inside edge (the inside of the spine) visible, you can create even margins across all edges of the page. This is appropriate if your magazine is going to be stapled or saddle-stitched, or if it’s very slim.

If your INDD magazine template has around 30 pages or more, it will probably need to be perfect bound, where the pages are glued into the spine of the cover casing. If this is the case, you will need to make the inside margin more generous. This forces content slightly off-center, allowing more blank space on the inside edge, which will be sucked into the spine by the bind.

Let’s set up our template to have margins which would suit a perfect-bound magazine. Set the **Top** margin to **13 mm**, the **Bottom** to **14 mm** (this allows a little more room for page numbers and helps your layouts to look more elegant), **Outside** to **13 mm**, and **Inside** to a slightly more generous **14 mm** (if your magazine is going to be very thick, you might want to add an extra millimeter or two to this).

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![margins](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/2.2.jpg)</figure></div>Finally, add a **Bleed** of **5 mm** to all edges of the page, except the **Inside** edge, which you can set to **0 mm**. As the document will be made up of facing two-page spreads, you won’t need a bleed on the inside edge.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![bleed](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/2.2.1.jpg)</figure></div>Click **OK** to create the INDD magazine template document.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![new document](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/2.2.2.jpg)</figure></div>## 3. How to Add Consistent Elements to Your Magazine

Flick through any magazine, and you’ll notice that there are always a few consistent elements applied across the pages.

The three main consistencies in any magazine layout are **column structure, page numbers, and running headers.**

Making a magazine in InDesign will help you with those. If you use parent pages in InDesign, these are quick and simple to set up, and they will help you to promote a uniform look across your magazine.

### Step 1

With your inside pages template still open, go to the **Pages** panel **(Window &gt; Pages)** and double-click on the **A-Parent** icon in the top section of the panel. This will open up the parent on your screen.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![parent on screen](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/3.1.jpg)</figure></div>The pages of your magazine will likely be made up of both text and images for the most part, and creating a basic column structure for your pages will allow you to channel text and images into a consistent grid layout.

Highlight both pages of the **A-Parent** in the **Pages** panel, and head up to **Layout &gt; Margins &amp; Columns**. Increase the **Number** of columns to **2** or **3**, depending on your preference. Increasing the **Gutter** between them to between **5** and **10 mm** will help to keep the columns of text nice and separate. Click **OK**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![margins and columns](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/3.1.1.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

From the **Pages** panel’s drop-down menu, choose **Parent Options for “A-Parent”.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![parent options](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/3.2.jpg)</figure></div>Rename the parent **‘Parent – Inside Spread’** and click **OK**. This parent will be the generic parent for most of the pages in your magazine.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![parent options](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/3.2.1.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 3

Take the **Type Tool (T)** and drag to create a small text frame in the far-right bottom corner of the right-hand page of the **A-Parent** spread. Set your type cursor into the frame and head up to **Type &gt; Insert Special Character &gt; Markers &gt; Current Page Number.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![current page number](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/3.3.jpg)</figure></div>InDesign will drop an *‘A’* character into the frame, which you can format with your own choice of font, color and size using either the **Character Formatting Controls** panel at the top of the workspace or the **Character** panel **(Window &gt; Type &amp; Tables &gt; Character).**

InDesign will adapt the *‘A’* to the page number of any page in your document which has the A-Parent applied to it.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![number](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/3.3.1.jpg)</figure></div>Select the page number text frame and **Edit &gt; Copy, Edit &gt; Paste.** Move into a mirrored position at the bottom-left corner of the left-hand page, and adjust the text to **Align Left.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![number pasted](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/3.3.2.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 4

Take the **Type Tool (T)** again and create a longer text frame across the top left corner of the left-hand page. Type in *‘MAGAZINE NAME’* and, as before, adjust the formatting until you’re happy with the result.

Then **Edit &gt; Copy, Edit &gt; Paste** the text frame, moving over to the right page, and adjust the text to read *‘ISSUE NO. MONTH’*. Adjust the text to **Align Right.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![align right text](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/3.4.jpg)</figure></div>When you start designing your magazine, you can easily head back into the A-Parent and adjust these to adapt to the magazine title, issue number, and date.

### Step 5

Select the **Type Tool (T)** and drag onto the left-hand page, creating a text frame that fits neatly within the first column. Allow the top of the text frame to sit a bit below the magazine title text frame, and the bottom to sit a bit above the page number text frame.

Select the text frame and **Copy** and **Paste** it repeatedly, moving a new text frame into each column.

Finally, hover over the bottom-right corner of the first text frame, and click on the blank white square you can find there. A chain link symbol will appear next to your cursor. Click into the next column along, linking the first text frame to the second. Repeat until all the columns are linked in a sequence.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![linked text frames](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/3.5.jpg)</figure></div>This means that when you have a full page of text in your InDesign magazine layout, you can simply **Place** or **Paste** text directly into the column structure, and the text will flow automatically throughout the column sequence. This is a neat little timesaver when putting together long magazine layouts.

### Step 6

Not every page of your magazine layout needs to feature page numbers, and indeed sometimes the opening pages of features or articles look better without page numbers. For this, we can create a new parent.

Select the **A-Parent** page icon in the **Pages** panel and choose **Duplicate Parent Spread “A-Parent – Inside Spread”**. This will create a new **B-Parent**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![duplicate parent](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/3.6.jpg)</figure></div>Select the **B-Parent** icon, and choose **Parent Options for B-Parent** from the menu.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![parent options](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/3.6.1.jpg)</figure></div>Rename the parent **‘Parent – Article Opening Spread’** and click **OK**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![opening spread](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/3.6.2.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 7

**Double-click** the **B-Parent** icon to open it up on screen. You can edit this spread to better suit the opening spread of a feature. Say, for example, you wanted to use a full-size picture across the spread to announce the start of an article. You wouldn’t need text frames for this sort of layout, so you can select the text frames in the columns and delete them.

You might also want to get rid of page numbers by selecting these text frames and deleting them.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![delete numbers](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/3.7.jpg)</figure></div>You can also select the running header text frame and reduce the **Tint** of their color to make them more subtle. You can do this directly from the **Swatches** panel **(Window &gt; Color &gt; Swatches)** by pulling the slider at the top-right of the panel to the left.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![swatch tint](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/3.7.1.jpg)</figure></div>To apply this B-Parent to the opening pages of your articles, you simply need to click and drag the **B-Parent** page icon down onto your chosen page in the **Pages** panel.

## 4. How to Adapt Your Template to Sections of Your Magazine

Most long documents, such as books and magazines, will benefit from being divided into sections. For magazines, you can create a very simple sectioned structure, with page numbers throughout only the main bulk of the magazine and a short section without page numbers at the start.

Many magazines fill their first few pages with adverts, a contents page, and sometimes an editor’s letter, and there’s often no need for these to be numbered.

### Step 1

Let’s say, as an example, that you want to start the actual content of your issue on the fifth page of your magazine layout in InDesign. You can always edit the sections later to make the numbered pages start earlier or later.

Remaining in your inside pages template, click onto **Page 5** in the **Pages** panel to highlight it. From the panel’s drop-down menu, choose **Numbering &amp; Section Options**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![numbering options](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/4.1.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

In the **New Section** window that opens, check the bullet next to **Start Page Numbering at:** and keep the number set to **1**.

Under **Style**, choose **1, 2, 3, 4…** from the drop-down menu.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![new section](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/4.2.jpg)</figure></div>Then click **OK**. InDesign will flag up a warning that you have duplicates of some page numbers (1-4) in your document, but that’s not a problem for our purposes here, so go ahead and click **OK**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![warning](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/4.2.1.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 3

Now you’ll see in the **Pages** panel that **Page 5** is now **Page 1**, marking the start of a new section. The page numbers on the pages themselves will also reflect this change.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![new section](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/4.3.jpg)</figure></div>Now you can get rid of the visible page numbers on the first section of your magazine, by either removing the **A-Parent** from pages 1-4 (to do this, drag down the **\[None\]** page icon at the top of the **Pages** panel onto each of these pages) or applying a different parent without page numbers.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![parent applied](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/4.3.1.jpg)</figure></div>I’ve done the latter here, dragging down the **B-Parent** page icons onto pages 1-4, allowing me to keep the running headers but removing the visible page numbers.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![section start](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/4.3.2.jpg)</figure></div>## You Learned How to Create a Magazine Template

Now you have a ready-to-save magazine template for both the inside pages and the cover of a magazine. Awesome work! Head up to **File &gt; Save As**, and save each separate template in a folder you can easily come back to.

When you come to work on InDesign magazine templates, **File &gt; Open** the template in InDesign, and **File &gt; Save As** the document straight away with a new file name, corresponding to the specific magazine you are creating.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![magazine template](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/28227/image/4.4.jpg)</figure></div>Now that you’ve laid down the groundwork for your magazine, including setting up the correct page sizes, margins, custom parents, running headers, page numbers, and sections, you’re ready to dive straight into designing.
