In this assignment, we will be exploring inspiration. In this particular project, we will explore this in a straightforward manner – taking the shape of one object and translating it to an imaginary construct.

Let’s watch the above video. Mainly from the 1:16min point onward. It shows an illustrator drawing an imaginary “robot.” His inspiration is the **top of a spray bottle**.


**Here are a few examples:**
