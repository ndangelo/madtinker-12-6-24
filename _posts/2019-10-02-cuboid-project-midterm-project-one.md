[![One Point Perspective for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/embed/nAlCyQqEZSU?feature=oembed)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/nAlCyQqEZSU?feature=oembed)

**UPDATE:**

Hello class,

Please review this revised blog entry concerning the midterm. I added images and drawings to illustrate the kind of constructs I’m looking for.

Remember. You can be as simple or complex as you feel comfortable with. Just clear it with me.

Best,

Nick

Utilizing your knowledge of one, two, and three-point perspective, draw a “construct” using only “cuboids” or simply box-shaped objects. Make “thumbnail” sketches to get an idea of what your composition will be like. Use an entire page in your sketchbook when you are ready to create the final drawing. Due: TBA.

Your construct can be as simple or as complex as you wish.
