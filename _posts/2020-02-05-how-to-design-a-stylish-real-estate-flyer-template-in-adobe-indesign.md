*What You’ll Be Creating*

Looking to entice customers to view a property on your books? This stylish real estate flyer template has a versatile design which can be easily adapted to your own content, photos, and branding. Suitable for beginners to InDesign, this tutorial will take you through the steps of creating the flyer from scratch and setting up the design ready for printing.

Ready to sell that house? Awesome, let’s get started…

## 1. How to Set Up the Flyer Layout in InDesign

### Step 1

Open up **Adobe InDesign** and head up to **File > New > Document.**

Set the **Intent** to **Print** and **Number of Pages** to **1**, and uncheck **Facing Pages** to set up a simple one-page document.

Set the **Width** of the page to **8.5 in (215.9 mm)** and **Height** to **11 in (279.4 mm)**, which is a standard flyer size.

Set the **Top Margin** to **15 mm, Bottom** to **18 mm**, and **Left** and **Right Margins** to **14 mm.** Add a **Bleed** of **5 mm** to all edges of the page, and click **OK** to create the document.

![new document window](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173819/1.15.jpg)

### Step 2

Expand the **Layers** panel **(Window > Layers)** and double-click on the default ***Layer 1*** name in the panel to open the **Layer Options** window. Rename the layer ***Photo*** and click **OK**.

Click on the **Create New Layer** button at the bottom of the panel to create a second layer. Rename it ***Shapes***. Create a third and final layer and rename this ***Typography***.

![layers panel](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173821/1.25.jpg)

Lock both the top ***Typography*** layer and ***Photo*** layer at the bottom, leaving the ***Shapes*** layer unlocked and selected.

## 2. How to Create Your Color Palette

### Step 1

This flyer design will need a four-color palette, with a dark neutral base color, a light neutral color for text, and two variants, light and dark, of a punchier color.

To create your palette, expand the **Swatches** panel **(Window > Color > Swatches)**, and click on the **New Swatch** button at the bottom of the panel.

First, let’s create our dark base color. Name the swatch **Off-Black**, and set the **Type** to **Process** and **Mode** to **CMYK**. Set the levels to **C=90 M=84 Y=47 K=63**, and click **Add** and then **OK**.

![off-black swatch](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173826/2.17.jpg)

### Step 2

Create a further three new CMYK swatches using the same process.

Here, I’ve created a pale swatch named **Grey**, **C=10 M=7 Y=7 K=0**, and two yellow swatches: **C=3 M=34 Y=93 K=0 (‘Mustard’)** and **C=7 M=17 Y=93 K=0 (‘Light Yellow’)**.

![swatch options](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173831/2.2.14.jpg)

## 3. How to Create a Geometric Design for Your Flyer

### Step 1

Take the **Rectangle Tool (M)** and drag across the page, extending it up to the bleed on the top, left and bottom edges, and across to roughly the halfway point of the page. Set the **Fill** to your **Off-Black** swatch.

![rectangle tool](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173834/3.15.jpg)

### Step 2

Select the **Pen Tool (P)** and use it to create a diagonal shape extending across the page, from the bottom-left corner to the top of the right side of the page. You want the ribbon to be reasonably thick, with perfectly parallel lines.

![pen tool](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173836/3.25.jpg)

Once you’ve created the rough shape and want to tweak the anchor points, you can use the **Direct Selection Tool (A)** to select individual points and move them around using the arrow keys.

Once you’re happy with the shape, adjust the **Fill** to **Light Yellow.**

![light yellow](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173838/3.2.1-4.jpg)

### Step 3

Take the **Scissors Tool (C)** and snip once where the top of the yellow shape meets the edge of the black rectangle, and once again where the shapes cross over at the bottom. This will split the yellow shape into two sections.

![scissors tool](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173841/3.35.jpg)

Select the top-right half of the yellow shape and go to **Object > Effects > Transparency.** Choose **Hard Light** from the **Mode** menu, and pull down the **Opacity** to around **90%**. Click **OK**.

![hard light](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173843/3.3.14.jpg)

### Step 4

Take the **Pen Tool (P)** again and zoom into the top-right corner of the page. Trace the edges of the blank space that remains, creating a sort of triangle shape.

![pen tool](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173846/3.45.jpg)

Set the **Fill** of this new shape to **Off-Black.**

![off-black ](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173848/3.4.1-4.jpg)

**Edit > Copy** the triangle shape, and **Edit > Paste in Place.**

![paste in place](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173849/3.4.2-3.jpg)

Return to the **Layers** panel and click on the small arrow to the left of the ***Shapes*** layer’s name, to expand the layer. Select the top ‘polygon’ element…

… and drag it down into the ***Photo*** layer below. You’ll have to unlock this layer first to do so.

![photo layer](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173851/3.4.3-3.jpg)

Then, with the moved triangle shape still selected, **Right-Click (Windows) or Control-Click (Mac) > Content > Graphic** to turn the shape into an image frame. We’ll come back to this a bit later.

![content graphic](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173853/3.4.4-3.jpg)

### Step 5

Lock the ***Photo*** layer and return to the ***Shapes*** layer above. Select the triangle shape that’s sitting on this layer, and go to **Object > Effects > Transparency**. Reduce the **Opacity** to **40%**, and click **OK**.

![transparency](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173854/3.5-3.jpg)

## 4. How to Add Photos to Your Flyer Design

### Step 1

Lock the ***Shapes*** layer and unlock the ***Photo*** layer below.

![photo layer](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173857/4.17.jpg)

Take the **Pen Tool (P)** and create another new shape. This time, focus on the bottom-right section of the page, creating a shape that fills the bottom-right gap as well as the top-right half of the yellow rectangle sitting on the layer above, This will create a rectangle shape with a triangular top.

![pen tool](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173859/4.1.1-3.jpg)

Set the **Fill** of the shape to **[None]** and then **Right-Click (Windows) or Control-Click (Mac) > Content > Graphic** to transform the shape into an image frame.

![content graphic](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/14173901/4.1.2-3.jpg)

### Step 2

With your new image frame still selected, go to **File > Place**. Choose an image of the property you want to feature, and click **Open**. Arrange [the image](https://pixabay.com/en/building-sky-architecture-
### Step 1

Open your logo up in **Adobe Illustrator** or a different vector-editing program, and adjust the **Fill** of the design to **White**. Then **Edit > Copy** the vector.

Return to your **InDesign** document and lock the ***Photo*** layer. Unlock the top layer, ***Typography***. **Edit > Paste** the vector logo directly onto your document.

Position the logo over the top-right half of the yellow shape.

I’ve added text below the logo design to complete the brand, setting the **Font** to **[Charlevoix Pro](https://graphicriver.net/item/charlevoix-pro-regular/15144030)**, and adjusting the **Font Color** to **[Paper]** from the **Swatches** panel.

### Step 2

Take the **Rectangle Tool (M)** and create a wide, squat rectangle across the top of the page, extending over to the halfway point of the page. Rest the top edge of the shape against the top margin, and set the **Fill** to **Mustard**.

Select the rectangle shape and **Edit > Copy, Edit > Paste**, moving it over to the right side of the page, meeting the right edge of the original rectangle shape. Go to **Object > Effects > Transparency**. Set the **Mode** to **Hard Light** and reduce the **Opacity** to **70%**.

### Step 3

Create a text frame using the **Type Tool (T)**, and type in *‘FOR SALE’* or whichever header you’d like to use. Set the **Font** to **Charlevoix Pro Medium, Font Size** to **37 pt, Tracking** to **110** and **Font Color** to **Grey**.

### Step 4

You can now start to add more text to your flyer design using the **Type Tool (T).**

Place text frames below the ribbon header, resting them against the left margin. Set the text in **Charlevoix Pro, Size 12 pt,** and increase the **Tracking** to **130** for a contemporary look. Set the **Font Color** to **Grey**.

Add more details about facilities, setting the text in **Light Yellow**. You can create bullet points by highlighting text and then clicking on the **Bulleted List** button in the **Character Formatting Controls** panel at the top of the workspace.

### Step 5

You can also place text over the bottom-left corner of the page. This is a good place to format a call-to-action or attention-grabbing offer.

Here I’ve set text in **Charlevoix Pro**, as before, and in the **Grey** swatch for subtle contrast against the yellow background.

## 6. How to Customize and Export Your Finished Flyer

### Step 1

It’s simple to change the color and branding of your flyer. To adjust the color scheme, create a new pair of light and dark color swatches from the **Swatches** panel. Here I’ve created a pale apple green and a slightly darker counterpart.

Then unlock the ***Shapes*** layer and select the top ribbon rectangles and large diagonal shape sections. You can adjust the **Fill** color of these to give your flyer a fresh look.

*(To recreate the look below, I’ve used an [image of a modern living room](https://pixabay.com/en/apartment-carpet-chair-contemporary-1835482/) and [this photo of a formal city street](https://pixabay.com/en/ancient-architecture-building-city-1867594/).)*

You can also experiment with the typography. Try changing the font from a clean sans serif like **Charlevoix Pro** to a more traditional serif like **Garamond** to make your flyer feel more aspirational and classic.

### Step 2

To export your flyer ready for sending to print, head up to **File > Export.**

From the **Format** drop-down menu at the bottom of the window, choose **Adobe PDF (Print)** and click **Save**.

In the **Export to Adobe PDF** window that opens, choose **[Press Quality]** from the **Preset** menu at the top of the window.

### Step 3

Click on **Marks and Bleeds** in the left-hand menu. Check the box reading **All Printer’s Marks** and check **Use Document Bleed Settings.**

Click **Export** to create a print-ready PDF that you can send straight off to the printers. Fantastic work!
