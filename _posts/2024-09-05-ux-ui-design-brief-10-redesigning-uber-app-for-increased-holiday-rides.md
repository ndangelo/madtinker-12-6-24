### Target Audience

**Jane Lee**, 34 | The Holiday Shopper  
**NEEDS:**  
Jane is a busy professional who relies on Uber for her holiday shopping trips. She needs reliable and quick transportation to navigate through the holiday traffic, and she appreciates easy access to in-app holiday deals and discounts. However, she often faces long wait times and difficulty finding available rides during peak shopping hours, which adds to her frustration. Managing multiple shopping bags while commuting also poses a challenge for her.

**Michael Patel**, 40 | The Family Traveler  
**NEEDS:**  
Michael is a parent who uses Uber to travel with his family during the holidays. He needs safe and spacious rides that can accommodate his entire family, with features like car seats and child safety locks. Scheduling rides in advance for holiday events is crucial for him. Unfortunately, he struggles to find large vehicles that meet his requirements and faces challenges in coordinating multiple pickups and drop-offs for family members, all while ensuring the safety and comfort of his children.

**Sarah Lee**, 28 | The Festive Party Goer  
**NEEDS:**  
Sarah is a social butterfly who relies on Uber to attend holiday parties. She seeks affordable and reliable rides, especially during peak party hours, and values the ability to share rides with friends easily. However, she frequently encounters high surge pricing and long wait times during holiday events. Coordinating ride-sharing with friends can also be a hassle, and the uncertainty of ride availability during busy periods adds to her stress.

### Testing and Results Section

Show your wireframes to 5 people and ask them using your designs what they think about them, what they would improve, and an overall rating.

Take their feedback, iterate the designs, and have a final round of testing with 5 users. See that you improve your overall rating. If not, go back to the drawing board, change your designs, and retest.
