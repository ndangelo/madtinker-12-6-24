### Well-chosen typography can take your branding designs from so-so to spectacular, but choosing the right font to use in logo design, and across stationery and marketing materials can seem a daunting task.

### **1. Try Out the Best of Both Worlds…** 

---

…Professional-looking fonts certainly don’t need to be dull!

Particularly if you’re designing marketing or branding materials for a creative individual or company, you want the typeface to strike the perfect balance of minimal professionalism and look-at-me creativity.

When Art Director [Iñaki Saiz Roiz](http://www.gregorsamsa.es/Laura-Solana-Arquitecto) came to design the branding for architect Laura Solana, he turned to [**Futura Bold**](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura/bold/) to give the logo and stationery a clean yet modern look.

### **2. Simple + Calligraphic = Branding Success!**

---

Teaming a pair of fonts together, one more corporate, the other more decorative, can be a great choice for designing brands for more creative companies.

Here, for an Artist Management company, Australian Designer [Matt Vergotis](http://www.verg.com.au/portfolio/mandy/) paired a clean sans serif for the bulk of text with a more decorative calligraphic typeface in the main logo. It makes for a really successful typographic team, and is a great formula to follow for your own brand designs—choose a calligraphic or brushstroke font that looks slick and modern, and pair with a more conservative sans serif. Job done!

For a similar look to the decorative calligraphic font used here, try out the classic-yet-modern [**Dynalight**](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/dynalight) or the retro-inspired [**Yellowtail**](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/yellowtail).

For the cleaner, corporate typeface, Matt used [**Ubuntu**](http://font.ubuntu.com/).

### **3. Make Retro Modern**

---

The retro revival in typography keeps getting stronger by the day. An added bonus—retro fonts can give your brand designs a touch of nostalgia, which makes the brand seem instantly more appealing and emotive to the customer.

The key to using retro-inspired fonts successfully in creative branding is to keep them looking fresh and modern. None of those scratchy vintage textures or distressed effects—keep them crisp and polished for a corporate-appropriate vibe.

Also from Australian Designer [Matt Vergotis](http://www.verg.com.au/portfolio/betafirm/) comes this fantastic demonstration of using retro fonts in a modern way, for web development company Betafirm. To imitate the font, give [**Lobster**](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Lobster) a whirl, or take [**Pacifico**](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/pacifico) for a spin.
