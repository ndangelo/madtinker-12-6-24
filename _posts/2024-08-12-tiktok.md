Business videos on TikTok examples (Source: [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/en/))

TikTok is a video-sharing app businesses can use for social media promotion with short-form videos that quickly became popular over the past few years.

Originally, TikTok didnâ€™t compete with other platforms as a small business social media marketing channel. But with its user base skyrocketing, businesses are able to effectively leverage hashtags, contests, and other brand-related content to promote their products.

To improve your TikTok social media marketing campaigns, here are some of the best practices to remember:

- Use hashtags
- Utilize trending video effects and music
- Post often
- Research viral audio and trends
- Write clear text descriptions for your videos
