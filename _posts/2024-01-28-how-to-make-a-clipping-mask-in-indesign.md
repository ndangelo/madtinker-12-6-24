We’ll use these images as we explore InDesign clipping masks. You are welcome to use them along with me as we learn how to crop an image in InDesign. Otherwise, make sure you have images of your own to work with.

## 1. How to Crop an Image in InDesign Using Frame Shapes

### Step 1

In InDesign, most objects we use are within frames. Interestingly, these can be considered masking shapes in and of themselves. As the frame and the content within can be moved separately, the masking in InDesign is built into the software.

We can use this to our advantage by creating frame shapes and pasting images we want to mask into them.

Within your document, import an image you’d like to mask by going to **File &gt; Place**.

Then select the image you want to use and press **Open**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Place Image in Document](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip1_step1.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

We can move the images from inside the frame by selecting the middle circle on the image. We can also use the **Transform Tool** to clip the edges of the images if needed.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![The Image Frame](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip1_step2.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 3

However, rather than using the default rectangle frame the image was imported into, let’s use different masking shapes to create a more interesting clipping path in InDesign.

From the toolbar, select the **Ellipse Frame Tool**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Select the Elipse Frame Tool](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip1_step3.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 4

Click and hold the circle clipping path InDesign tool over the top of your image. This is a good way to gauge where you want your masking shapes to be placed. In this case, I’m going to create a clipping mask over a single bird in this image.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Drag Ellipse Tool](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip1_step4.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 5

Go back to your image by using the **Selection Tool** and clicking on it. Now, cut the image using **Edit &gt; Cut**.

You can also copy the image if you would like! Cutting is a good idea, though, so that we don’t have multiple copies of the same image on our stage.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Cut the Image](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip1_step5.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 6

Now that you have cut the image, select the circle frame we created. Now go to **Edit &gt; Paste Into**.

Note that the other methods of pasting the image will give the image a new frame rather than placing it into the frame we just created.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Pasting Image into Circle Frame](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip1_step6.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 7

And there you have a quick way to crop in InDesign with different shapes. Of course, you can use this same method with all the frame shape tools, including the Rectangle and Polygon Frame Tool.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Images Masked with Circle](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip1_step7.jpg)</figure></div>## 2. How to Create a Clipping Mask Using Customized Frame Shapes

### Step 1

While the Frame Shape tools are useful, there may be times when you need more complex clipping masks to crop an image in InDesign. Luckily, we can create complex shapes by using the Pen Tool. Let’s look at how to do a clipping mask in InDesign with customized shapes.

Start by selecting the **Pen Tool** from the toolbar.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Select Pen Tool](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip2_step1.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

Next, we’ll create a clipping path in InDesign to use as the shape of our clipping mask.

Create a single point, and then click again in another spot. Continue this process to create a shape that works for you.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Create Clipping Shape](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip2_step2b.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 3

When you are satisfied with your clipping path in InDesign, close it up by connecting the line to the starting point. If it’s not perfect, don’t worry too much—we can make edits and refine our mask at any point!

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Close Up Clipping Shape](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip2_step3b.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 4

Next, we want to get the image into our new clipping mask in InDesign, so it can act as a clipping mask. With the **Selection Tool** selected, click on the image to select it. Then cut it (**Edit &gt; Cut**).

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Cut Image For Clipping Mask](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip2_step4b.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 5

Now select the masking in InDesign once again. To paste the image we cut into the frame, we have to use a special form of paste. To do this, go to **Edit &gt; Paste Into**.

By using **Paste Into**, we are placing the images into the frame we created.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Paste Image Into Custom Clipping Shape](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip2_step5b.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 6

Now the background is gone, revealing only the shape of what we cut out. Now you can use the move tools, just like with the rectangular frame the image started in. As you can see, this is a really powerful tool that leaves a lot of room for creativity.

The Pen Tool is also very versatile, so you can work with just about any shape you need.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Completed Clipping Mask](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip2_step6b.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 7

Let’s refine our new clipping mask a bit!

The shape we just created may have a stroke around it due to using the Pen Tool. We can remove this from the **Properties** panel.

With the shape frame selected, set the **Stroke** to 0.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Stroke Settings](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip2_step7b.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 8

One of the benefits of creating our own shapes is that we can use the anchor points to edit the mask. By using the **Direct Selection** tool, we can move around the anchor points.

To do this, select the **Direct Selection** tool and then double-click an anchor point. You will now be able to move it to a better position. This is a great tool for when you need to make edits to your clipping masks at a later point in the project.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![graphic](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip2_step8b.jpg)</figure></div>## 3. How to Crop in InDesign With a Typeface as a Clipping Mask

### Step 1

Next, let’s take a look at how to crop an image in InDesign with text clipping mask techniques.

Using the shape tools for masking in InDesign has many uses. However, tracing over typography with the Pen Tool would be really time-consuming. Luckily, there is a handy tool for turning typefaces into a layer mask.

To start, create some type by selecting the Text Tool. Place your text, and choose your typeface and font size.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Typeface Set](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip3_step1.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

Now select the text frame with the Selection Tool. Then go to **Type &gt; Create Outlines**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Create Outliens For Type](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip3_step2.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 3

Now that we have the outlines created, we can paste an image into this frame. To do this, cut the image and then select the typed outline.

Then go to **Edit &gt; Paste Into**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Paste Image into Text Outlines](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2635/posts/34544/image/tip3_step3.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 4

Now, you can move around your image as needed.
