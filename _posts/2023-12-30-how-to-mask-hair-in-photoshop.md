## How to Mask Hair in Photoshop

### Step 1

No matter the texture or color, all hair types go through similar first steps with Photoshop hair masking. Let’s start by making a rough selection of the hair.

You can try using **Select Subject,** the **Magnetic Lasso** tool, or **Quick Select.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![start by making a rough selection of the hair.](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/12/02121825/sdf-4.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">[Woman with long and shiny curly hair](https://elements.envato.com/beauty-fashion-model-girl-with-colorful-dyed-hair-RTLMEP5)</figcaption></figure></div>### Step 2

Add a **Layer Mask** to the subject.

If any large chunks of hair need to be roughly masked in, use a hard **Brush** set to white for some manual Photoshop hair masking.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Add a Layer Mask to the subject.](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/12/02121826/0003_2.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 3

Once you’ve finished your rough hair masking in Photoshop, ensure the layer mask is active and go to **Select and Mask** in the **Windows &gt; Properties** panel.

Select and mask is one of the most powerful tools for masking hair in Photoshop, and it also works for fur, cloth, and other fine details.

Click on the **Refine Hair** button in the upper toolbar of Select and Mask.

### Step 4 

Next, select the **Refine Edge** brush from the left side toolbar.

*Check the box* for **Smart Radius** under **Edge Detection**, and set the **Radius** to **3 px.**

Drag the Refine Edge cursor along the hair’s edge. If it captures too much inner hair or background, hold **Alt/Option** to remove it from the selection.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![select the Refine Edge brush and trace the edges of the image ](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/12/02121828/0002_3.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 5 

Finish by choosing **Decontaminate Color,** setting it to **70%.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Finish by choosing Decontaminate Color](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/12/02121829/0001_4.jpg)</figure></div><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![final result](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/12/02121830/0000_5.jpg)</figure></div>## That’s It! 

That’s how to do hair masking in Photoshop! You’ve successfully tackled the tricky realm of hair masking and refinement. With these techniques in your arsenal, you’re on your way to becoming a pro at digital image manipulation.

Remember, practice makes perfect, so don’t be afraid to experiment with different images featuring various hair types and textures. Happy editing!
