**[Sample Files](https://learndownload.adobe.com/pub/learn/indesign/add-work-with-graphics.zip)**  
**What you learned:** Add graphics to projects

In InDesign, you can bring raster images, like an image you take with your phone, or vector graphics, like a logo, into your documents:  
1. Choose File > Place to place a graphic (or multiple graphics) in your document.
2. Click Open. If a frame was selected before placing, the graphic is placed within the frame.
3. With the Selection tool in the toolbox, drag a corner point of a graphic frame to resize the frame and to reveal or hide parts of the image.
4. Drag within the graphic area (not the center) to reposition the graphic and the frame.

## Learn about linked graphics

Explore graphic linking using the Links panel.

![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/19161806/bf8afb32_960x540.jpg)](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/19161806/bf8afb32_960x540.jpg)

**What you learned:** Graphic linking

Graphics placed in InDesign are linked by default to the original file outside InDesign. If a placed graphic is updated outside InDesign, the graphic is automatically updated in InDesign.

---

## Wrap text around objects

Discover how to wrap text around content using the Text Wrap panel.

![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/19161927/c60fb46a_960x540.jpg)](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/19161927/c60fb46a_960x540.jpg)

**What you learned:** Wrap text

You can wrap text around any object, including text frames, graphics, and objects you draw in InDesign. Text wrap is applied to the object being wrapped, not the text itself.

---

## Change the color of content

Explore how to apply color to content using existing colors and colors you create.

![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/19162911/b06a365c_960x540.jpg)](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/19162911/b06a365c_960x540.jpg)  
**[Sample Files](https://learndownload.adobe.com/pub/learn/indesign/apply-color-effects.zip)**  
**What you learned:** Change the color of content

Content in InDesign can have a color stroke (border) and a color fill. Clicking the fill color or stroke color in the Properties panel reveals colors saved in a document, called swatches.

---

Bring text files into Adobe InDesign from Microsoft Word, and more. 

![Image](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/18180446/31e7c651_960x540.jpg)](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/18180446/31e7c651_960x540.jpg)

[**Watch Video**](https://helpx.adobe.com/mena_en/indesign/how-to/apply-color-effects.html?playlist=/services/playlist.helpx/products:SG_INDESIGN_1_1/learn-path:get-started/set-header:ccx-designer/playlist:ccl-get-started-1/en_MENA.json&ref=helpx.adobe.com)

**What you learned: Import text**

Text can be pasted, dragged, or placed into an InDesign document from an outside source, such as Microsoft Word. Text can be placed in an existing text frame or in a frame that InDesign created when placing the text.

- Choose File > Place to place a text file such as .DOC, .RTF, or .TXT. Depending on the file type, you may be able to set options, such as removing the formatting.
- Click to place the text in an existing text frame, or click (or click and drag) to have InDesign create a text frame.

## Flow text between frames

Discover how to flow text from one frame to another. 

[![Image](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/18180632/5a133e86_960x540.jpg)](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/18180632/5a133e86_960x540.jpg)

[**Watch Video**](https://helpx.adobe.com/mena_en/indesign/how-to/apply-color-effects.html?playlist=/services/playlist.helpx/products:SG_INDESIGN_1_1/learn-path:get-started/set-header:ccx-designer/playlist:ccl-get-started-1/en_MENA.json&ref=helpx.adobe.com)

**What you learned: Connect text frames**

You can connect text frames so that text flows between them. This is called threading text. Text frames have an in port and out port that are used to connect text frames and also visualize any connections. A red plus in the out port indicates that text doesn’t fit in the frame. This is called overset text.

To thread text:  
1. With the Selection tool, click to select a text frame and then click the out port (or in port) to load a text cursor.
2. Position the loaded text cursor within an existing text frame and click to thread the text or drag to create a new text frame.
3. Choose View > Extras > Show Text Threads to see the threads between the frames.

[**Sample Files**](https://learndownload.adobe.com/pub/learn/indesign/edit-modify-content.zip)

**What you learned: Create and edit frames**

Frames can be created and used as placeholders (a frame without content) and as graphic elements. The tools used to create frames are located in the toolbox. Press and hold the Rectangle Frame tool or Rectangle tool to reveal other tools. The Rectangle tool creates unassigned frames, which contain neither text or graphics to start and can be used for drawing a colored shape, for instance.

A frame size can be changed numerically in the Properties panel.  
- With a frame selected, you can edit the corner radius by clicking the yellow box in the upper-right of a frame, then dragging a corner. The corner radius can also be edited for a selected shape by choosing Object > Corner Options, setting the options, then clicking OK.

- Set a reference point in the Properties panel to transform content around a point other than the center.
- Temporarily locking content can prevent it from being accidentally edited. To lock content, select the content with the Selection tool and choose Object > Lock or press Control+L (Windows) or Command+L (macOS). A lock icon appears on the frame edge. To unlock an individual object, click the lock icon on the bounding box of the selected object. To unlock all locked content on a page, choose Object > Unlock All On Spread.

2. With the Selection tool, double-click an object in a group to edit it individually. Press Escape to stop editing and regroup the objects.

Aligning content:
- To align objects to one another, select the objects to align, then select an align option in the Properties panel or in the Align panel (Window > Object & Layout > Align).
- Choose an option from the Align To menu in the Properties panel to align content to the page, margins, or other elements on the page.

Ruler guides are nonprinting objects used for aligning content that can be positioned anywhere. There are two types of ruler guides: page guides and spread guides.
- With nothing selected, click the Show Rulers button in the Properties panel to show the page rulers. Drag from either the horizontal or vertical ruler into the page or pasteboard area to create a guide. Edit guides by dragging them or selecting them to edit using the X or Y value in the Properties panel.
- Use a guide for alignment by dragging objects close to the guide. When an object is close enough, the edge of the object will snap to (be pulled toward) the guide.
- Drag the zero point on the rulers to start the zero on each ruler from somewhere besides the default upper-left corner of the page. Double-click the zero point to reset the zero on each ruler to the upper-left corner of the active page.
- To lock guides, click the Lock Guides button in the Properties panel with nothing selected, or choose View > Grids & Guides > Lock Guides. To hide guides, click the Hide Guides button in the Properties panel with nothing selected, or choose View > Grids & Guides > Hide Guides.
