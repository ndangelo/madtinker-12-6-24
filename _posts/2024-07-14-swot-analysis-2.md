## SWOT stands for **S**trengths, **W**eaknesses, **O**pportunities, and **T**hreats.

A “SWOT analysis” involves carefully assessing these four factors in order to make clear and effective plans.

A SWOT analysis can help you to challenge risky assumptions, uncover dangerous blindspots, and reveal important new insights.

The SWOT analysis process is most effective when done collaboratively.

## What Is a SWOT Analysis?

SWOT analysis assesses a business’s Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, offering insights into current capabilities and future strategies. It helps identify competitive advantages, areas needing improvement, and external factors impacting the organization. This strategic tool guides businesses in making informed decisions by evaluating both internal and external dynamics. The process involves thorough analysis and documentation to uncover actionable insights for effective planning and protection against competitive risks.

In this article, video and infographic, we explore how to carry out a SWOT analysis, and how to put your findings into action. We also include a worked example and a template to help you get started on a SWOT analysis in your own workplace.

SWOT analysis is invaluable for challenging assumptions and uncovering blind spots in your organization’s performance. When used thoughtfully and collaboratively, it provides fresh insights into your current business position and facilitates the development of tailored strategies for any scenario.

For instance, while you might be aware of certain strengths within your organization, juxtaposing them with weaknesses and threats can reveal their true reliability. Similarly, while weaknesses may raise concerns, a systematic SWOT analysis could unveil overlooked opportunities that could outweigh these concerns.

## How to Write a SWOT Analysis

SWOT analysis involves making lists – but so much more, too! When you begin to write one list (say, Strengths), the thought process and research that you’ll go through will prompt ideas for the other lists (Weaknesses, Opportunities or Threats). And if you compare these lists side by side, you will likely notice connections and contradictions, which you’ll want to highlight and explore.

You’ll find yourself moving back and forth between your lists frequently. So, make the task easier and more effective by arranging your four lists together in one view.

A SWOT matrix is a 2×2 grid, with one square for each of the four aspects of SWOT. (Figure 1 shows what it should look like.) Each section is headed by some questions to get your thinking started.

#### Figure 1. A SWOT Analysis Matrix.

<figure class="wp-block-table">| **Strengths** What do you do well? What unique resources can you draw on? What do others see as your strengths? | **Weaknesses** What could you improve? Where do you have fewer resources than others? What are others likely to see as weaknesses? |
|---|---|
|  |  |
| **Opportunities** What opportunities are open to you? What trends could you take advantage of? How can you turn your strengths into opportunities? | **Threats** What threats could harm you? What is your competition doing? What threats do your weaknesses expose to you? |

## How to Do a SWOT Analysis

Avoid relying on your own, partial understanding of your organization. Your assumptions could be wrong. Instead, gather a team of people from a range of functions and levels to build a broad and insightful list of observations.

Then, every time you identify a Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, or Threat, write it down in the relevant part of the SWOT analysis grid for all to see.

Let’s look at each area in more detail and consider what fits where, and what questions you could ask as part of your data gathering.

### Strengths

Strengths are the capabilities and advantages that set your organization apart from competitors. They encompass what your organization excels at and what drives its success, such as motivated staff, access to unique resources, or efficient processes. These strengths form the core of your organization’s operations and reflect its Unique Selling Proposition (USP). It’s crucial to consider how these strengths are perceived by competitors and how they contribute to gaining a competitive edge in the market. Importantly, a true strength is one that provides a distinct advantage in your industry, rather than merely meeting basic market expectations.

### Weaknesses

Weaknesses, like strengths, are inherent features of your organization, so focus on your people, resources, systems, and procedures. Think about what you could improve, and the sorts of practices you should avoid.

Once again, imagine (or find out) how other people in your market see you. Do they notice weaknesses that you tend to be blind to? Take time to examine how and why your competitors are doing better than you. What are you lacking?

Be honest! A SWOT analysis will only be valuable if you gather all the information you need. So, it’s best to be realistic now, and face any unpleasant truths as soon as possible.

### Opportunities

Opportunities are favorable circumstances external to your organization that can lead to positive outcomes, provided you seize them proactively. These arise from developments in the market, advancements in technology, or changes in societal and regulatory landscapes. Recognizing and capitalizing on opportunities is crucial for enhancing your organization’s competitive edge and market leadership. Even small advantages can contribute significantly to your competitiveness. Monitoring market trends, shifts in government policies, and changes in societal behaviors can unveil promising opportunities for growth and innovation.

### Threats

Threats are external factors that pose potential risks to your business, such as supply chain disruptions, shifts in market demands, or difficulties in recruiting skilled personnel. It’s essential to foresee these threats and take preemptive measures to mitigate their impact before they hinder your growth.

Consider the challenges in bringing your products to market and meeting evolving quality standards or specifications. Technological advancements can present both threats and opportunities. Monitoring competitors’ actions is crucial, but adapting your strategy should be based on what aligns best with your organization’s goals rather than simply following trends.

Assess whether your business is particularly vulnerable to certain external challenges, like cash flow issues or market fluctuations, which could significantly affect your operations. Being vigilant about potential threats ensures proactive management and protects your business from unforeseen setbacks.

## A SWOT Analysis Example

Imagine this scenario: a small start-up consultancy wants a clear picture of its current situation, to decide on a future strategy for growth. The team gathers, and draws up the SWOT Analysis shown in Figure 2.

#### Figure 2. A Completed SWOT Analysis.

<figure class="wp-block-table">| **Strengths** What do you do well? What unique resources can you draw on? What do others see as your strengths? | **Weaknesses** What could you improve? Where do you have fewer resources than others? What are others likely to see as weaknesses? |
|---|---|
| We are able to respond very quickly as we have no red tape, and no need for higher management approval.We are able to give really good customer care, as the current small amount of work means we have plenty of time to devote to customers.Our lead consultant has a strong reputation in the market.We can change direction quickly if we find that our marketing is not working.We have low overheads, so we can offer good value to customers. | Our company has little market presence or reputation.We have a small staff, with a shallow skills base in many areas.We are vulnerable to vital staff being sick or leaving.Our cash flow will be unreliable in the early stages. |
| **Opportunities** What opportunities are open to you? What trends could you take advantage of? How can you turn your strengths into opportunities? | **Threats** What threats could harm you? What is your competition doing? What threats do your weaknesses expose to you? |
| Our business sector is expanding, with many future opportunities for success.Local government wants to encourage local businesses.Our competitors may be slow to adopt new technologies. | Developments in technology may change this market beyond our ability to adapt.A small change in the focus of a large competitor might wipe out any market position we achieve. |

</figure>The team’s analysis clearly shows that the consultancy’s main strengths lie in its agility, technical expertise, and low overheads. These allow it to offer excellent customer service to a relatively small client base.

The company’s weaknesses also involve its size. It will need to invest in training to improve the skills base of the small staff and focus on retention so it doesn’t lose key team members.

There are opportunities to offer rapid-response, good-value services to local businesses and to local government organizations. The company can likely be first to market with new products and services, given that its competitors are slow adopters.

The threats require the consultancy to keep up with changes in technology. Given its vulnerability to large-scale changes in its market, it also needs to keep a close eye on its largest competitors. To counteract this, the business needs to focus its marketing on selected industry websites to get the greatest possible market presence on a small advertising budget.

## Frequently Asked Questions About SWOT Analysis

### 1. Who Invented SWOT Analysis?

Many people attribute SWOT Analysis to Albert S. Humphrey. However, there has been some debate on the originator of the tool, as discussed in the [International Journal of Business Research](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2615722).

### 2. What Does SWOT Analysis Stand For?

SWOT Analysis stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats.

### 3. What Can a SWOT Analysis Be Used For?

SWOT analysis is a useful tool to help you determine your organization’s position in the market. You can then use this information to create an informed strategy suited to your needs and capabilities.

### 4. How Do I Write a SWOT Analysis?

To conduct a SWOT analysis, you first need to create a 2×2 matrix grid. Each square is then assigned to one of the four aspects of SWOT. You can either draw this grid yourself or use our [downloadable template](https://nova-live-content.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/public/content-downloadable/SWOTAnalysisWorksheet_2.pdf) to get started.

### 5. How Do SWOT Analysis and the TOWS Matrix compare?

While SWOT analysis puts the emphasis on the internal environment (your strengths and weaknesses), [TOWS](https://www.mindtools.com/auqstul/the-tows-matrix) forces you to look at your external environment first (your threats and opportunities). In most cases, you’ll do a SWOT Analysis first, and follow up with a TOWS Matrix to offer a broader context.

### 6. What Are the Biggest SWOT Analysis Mistakes?

- **Making your lists too long.** Ask yourself if your ideas are feasible as you go along.
- **Being vague.** Be specific to provide more focus for later discussions.
- **Not seeing weaknesses.** Be sure to ask customers and colleagues what they experience in real life.
- **Not thinking ahead.** It’s easy to come up with nice ideas without taking them through to their logical conclusion. Always consider their practical impact.
- **Being unrealistic.** Don’t plan in detail for opportunities that don’t exist yet. For example, that export market you’ve been eyeing may be available at some point, but the trade negotiations to open it up could take years.
- **Relying on SWOT Analysis alone.** SWOT Analysis is valuable. But when you use it alongside other planning tools (SOAR, TOWS or PEST), the results will be more vigorous.

## How to Use a SWOT Analysis

Use a SWOT Analysis to assess your organization’s current position **before** you decide on any new strategy. Find out what’s working well, and what’s not so good. Ask yourself where you want to go, how you might get there – and what might get in your way.

Once you’ve examined all four aspects of SWOT, you’ll want to build on your strengths, boost your weaker areas, head off any threats, and exploit every opportunity. In fact, you’ll likely be faced with a long list of potential actions.

But before you go ahead, be sure to develop your ideas further. Look for potential connections **between** the quadrants of your matrix. For example, could you use some of your strengths to open up further opportunities? And, would even more opportunities become available by eliminating some of your weaknesses?

Finally, it’s time to ruthlessly prune and prioritize your ideas, so that you can focus time and money on the most significant and impactful ones. Refine each point to make your comparisons clearer. For example, only accept precise, verifiable statements such as, “Cost advantage of $30/ton in sourcing raw material x,” rather than, “Better value for money.”

Remember to apply your learnings at the right level in your organization. For example, at a product or product-line level, rather than at the much vaguer whole-company level. And use your SWOT analysis alongside other strategy tools (for example, Core Competencies Analysis), so that you get a comprehensive picture of the situation you’re dealing with.

## SWOT Analysis Tips

Here are four tips for getting more out of a SWOT analysis:

1. **Be specific.** The more focused and accurate you are about the points you write down, the more useful your SWOT analysis will be.
2. **Work backwards.** Experiment with filling in the four sections of your SWOT analysis in a different order, to stimulate new ways of thinking. Working backwards, in particular, from threats to strengths, may cast new light on the situation.
3. **Get together.** Highlight the most useful people to contribute to your SWOT analysis, then gather information and ideas from them all.
4. **SWOT your competition**! To stay ahead of your competitors, carry out a regular SWOT analysis on **them**. Use everything you know about them to evaluate their situation, and use SWOT analysis to plan your competitive strategies accordingly.
