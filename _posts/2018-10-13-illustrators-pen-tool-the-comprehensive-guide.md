If you use Adobe Illustrator, then it’s almost certain that you use the Pen Tool when creating your paths. This comprehensive guide aims to introduce or remind you of features, shortcuts, and methods for working with what is arguably Adobe’s most essential tool.

## 1. Functions

### Pen Tool (P)
Click on artboard to create paths with straight segments, click and drag to create paths with [Bezier curves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve).

### Add Anchor Point Tool (+)
Click on a path segment to add anchor points.

### Delete Anchor Point Tool (-)
Click on anchor point to remove from path.

### Convert Anchor Point (Shift-C)
Click on an anchor point and drag to create bezier handles where there were none, click on an anchor point with handles to remove them.

Alternatively, click and drag midway along a path to manipulate it as a curve.

### Scissors Tool (C)
Not part of the Pen Tool group, but definitely associated with it. Click on a path segment to divide into two paths.

## 2. Keyboard Shortcuts
- Select **Pen Tool (P)**
- Select **Add Anchor Point Tool (+)**
- Select **Delete Anchor Point Tool (-)**
- Select **Convert Anchor Point Tool (Shift-C)**
- Select **Scissors Tool (C)**
- Join two anchor points **(Command/Control-J)**

## 3. The Cursors
The Pen Tool takes on different forms depending on what you’re doing when you’re using it. Each cursor intuitively makes you aware of the action you are about to perform.

(Caps Lock to toggle between pointer and cross hair)

![Cursor 3](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2016/09/27190231/cursor-3.png)
![Cursor 4](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2016/09/27190230/cursor-4.png)

## 4. Secondary Mouse Controls (With Path Selected)
1. Pen Tool hovers over anchor point: changes to Delete Anchor Point Tool
2. Pen Tool hovers over path segment: changes to Add Anchor Point Tool
3. Pen Tool hovers over end anchor point: changes to Continue Anchor Point Tool

## 5. Keyboard Controls
1. Hold **Shift** to constrain movements to 45°, 90°, 135° or 180° whilst creating or editing anchor points and handles.
2. Select anchor point with **Direct Selection Tool (A)** and click **Delete**. Anchor and adjoining path segments will be deleted leaving two paths.
3. **Pen Tool-Option** (**Alt**): changes to Convert Anchor Point Tool.
4. **Pen Tool** hover over bezier handle + **Command** (**Control**): allows editing of bezier curve.
5. **Pen Tool-Option** (**Alt**) whilst creating bezier curve: splits curve (unhinges handles).
6. **Pen Tool** hover over bezier handle + **Option** (**Alt**): splits curve (unhinges handles).
7. **Scissors Tool (C)**–**Option** (**Alt**): changes to Add anchor point tool.
8. **Add Anchor Point Tool-Option** (**Alt**): changes to Delete Anchor Point Tool.
9. **Delete Anchor Point Tool-Option** (**Alt**): changes to Add Anchor Point Tool.

## 6. Preferences
You can access the preferences which influence the Pen Tool (P) and other related tools by going to **Illustrator > Preferences > Selection & Anchor Display**.

![Preferences](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2016/09/27190223/preferences.png)

### Tolerance
Radius of the selection area around anchor points. Must be between 1 and 8 pixels, 1px if you’re deadly accurate with your mouse or have a lot of anchors in close range of one another, 8px if you prefer less precision. 3px is the default value.

![Tolerance](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2016/09/27190221/pref_1.png)

### Object Selection by Path Only
When checked, this option allows selection of objects only by clicking their paths. Clicking on their filled areas is ineffective, comparable to working in Outline mode (**View > Outline**).

![Object Selection](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2016/09/27190220/pref_2.png)

### Snap to Point
Also checkable via **View > Snap to Point**, though via the **Selection & Anchor Display** dialogue the tolerance can also be determined from 1 to 8 pixels. This value again represents the radius around anchor points. When lining up two objects, anchor points from one will snap to points of the other should they be positioned within the specified range.

![Snap to Point](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2016/09/27190219/pref_3.png)

It’s worth noting that since the release of Adobe Illustrator CC Bezier handles are immune to grid-snapping. You can therefore make sure your anchors all stick to the grid (great for web use) whilst maintaining precision with free curves.

### Anchor Point and Handle Display
Determines the way in which your path anchor points and handles are displayed.

![Anchor and Handle Display](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2016/09/27190215/pref_5.png)

### Highlight Anchors on Mouseover
When checked, highlights anchor points when hovered over with cursor.

![Highlight Anchors](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2016/09/27190214/pref_6.png)

### Show Handles When Multiple Anchors are Selected
When checked, this options displays the handles of points when multiple points are selected. Otherwise, handles of multiple selected points are *not* displayed.

![Show Handles](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2016/09/27190214/pref_6.png)

### Hide Corner Widget
Corner widgets allow you to drag corners in order to make them rounded. You may find it helpful to specify the corner angle at which you no longer want to have the widget displayed. Choose from 105°, 120°, 135°, 150° or 165°.

### Enable Rubber Band
When wanting to lay down an anchor point I always find it helpful to know what the path will look like. Checking the **Rubber Band** option gives you a preview of the path before you commit.

## 7. Other Shortcuts and Tips
Select the **Direct Selection Tool (A)** before selecting the Pen Tool (P). **Hold-Command (Control)** to give you access to the last tool selected (in this case the Direct Selection Tool) for editing of paths and handles without deselecting the path.

With path selected, use the **Spacebar** to give you access to the **Hand Tool (H)**. Move your screen without deselecting the path or changing tools.

While creating or editing an anchor point, click and **Click-Hold-Spacebar** to alter the position of the anchor point you’re working on. Since the release of Adobe Illustrator CC 2014 this manipulation is also possible on the closing anchor of a path.

![Move](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2016/09/27190211/move.png)

With the **Direct Selection Tool (A)** select the end point and starting point of a path. **Command (Control)-J** to Join.

With the **Direct Selection Tool (A)** select the end point and starting point of a path. **Command (Control)-Option (Alt)-Shift-J** to join and average simultaneously.

Bear in mind that the color of your highlighted paths and their Bezier handles is dependent on the color of the layer they’re placed on.

To smoothen a path by reducing the number of anchor points open the **Simplify** dialogue (**Object > Path > Simplify
