## **Target Audience**

**1. Emily Smith, 28 | The First-Time Host**

Emily is a young professional eager to become a first-time Airbnb host. She needs a straightforward, step-by-step onboarding process with clear instructions and visual guides to help her set up her first listing confidently. However, she feels overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information and steps required, fearing she might make mistakes due to her lack of experience in managing property rentals and dealing with guests.

**2. John Davis, 45 | The Part-Time Host**

John is a busy professional looking to host part-time on Airbnb. He needs an efficient onboarding process that requires minimal time investment, along with tools that simplify the management of his listing. Despite his enthusiasm, John struggles with balancing hosting responsibilities with his demanding work schedule. He often finds the process frustrating, especially when technical difficulties arise or instructions are unclear, and he requires quick and responsive customer support to resolve any issues promptly.

**3. Sarah Thompson, 52 | The Vacation Property Owner**

Sarah is an experienced property investor with multiple vacation properties. She needs a reliable and comprehensive platform that supports the efficient management of multiple listings, along with access to market insights and analytics to optimize her listings and pricing. However, Sarah finds managing multiple properties complex, ensuring they meet Airbnb’s standards, and handling guest inquiries seamlessly. The challenges of efficiently managing bookings and maintaining high standards across all properties add to her stress.

Show your wireframes to 5 people and ask them, using your designs, what they think about them, what they would improve, and an overall rating.

Take their feedback, iterate the designs, and have a final round of testing with five users. See that you improve your overall rating. If not go back to the drawing board and change your designs and retest.
