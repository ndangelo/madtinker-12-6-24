Infographics will not just require typical data visualization techniques. There are other common graphics you can use like **badges, stickers, and buttons** to showcase smaller tidbits of information. Think about other alternatives like progress steps in a web form.

The beauty of creating an infographic is that you can **bend the rules to include almost any element, as long as it fits well within the whole design.** Digital interfaces are fickle but easy to manipulate in the right context.

There are many sites that you can use for the visual component of this assignment, so the hard part for you is deciding what the key points of the business that you need to highlight.
