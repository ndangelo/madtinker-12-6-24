#### PROJECT BRIEF

**Design a fictional exhibition or installation to create change.**

You will individually research potential topics and present them to the class for discussion. Then you will form teams based on what topic(s) interest you. (Teams of ideally 3, but can be 2 or 4.)

Your project must identify and explain a problem and create a call-to-action. In other words, your objective is to convince your audience to take a particular action in order to address the issue that you present.

Find a topic that personally interests you. What bothers you? What do you think needs to change? The issue you choose must allow in-depth research into the subject, and your exhibition must present facts and sufficient background information to ‘present your case.’ Your call-to-action should involve asking people to do something in the installation itself, or doing something as a follow-up action.

**Topic Examples**  
For inspiration, find many topics on NPR.org. For local issues visit [http://www.kuow.org](http://www.kuow.org/)

NPR Story: Seattle is Really Good at Recycling. Maybe Too Good.   
Your project: Transform a garbage truck into a roving exhibition to communicate the problems and wider impacts associated with incorrect sorting of landfill / recycling / compost.

NPR Story: Coming of Age With Autism   
Your project: Educate people about adults with autism, creating a series of spaces or experiences that put the visitor ‘into the shoes of’ an autistic adult. Call to action might be encouragement to employers to re-think the disability.

NPR Story: Should Some Seattle Streets only be for Pedestrians?  
Your project: Create a street-based installation that informs residents about the challenges around increasing traffic and congestion, and advocates for a series of pedestrian-only and bike-only streets.

**Specifications**  
Thoroughly research your subject and develop 3-d installation or exhibition concepts based on this research. The exhibition must contain real text/image content which presents the case for change. The format and proposed location of the display should be appropriate to the topic.

— Your message / call-to-action  
What change are you trying to provoke? What action do you want? This guides design decisions.

— Audience  
Who are you trying to reach and why? Are you using visual language that will appeal to that audience? Is it in the right place? Is the message convincing enough to provoke change?

— Location  
Your project can be indoors or outside. It must be shown in a real location which is relevant to your audience and your objectives. For example at a series of bus stops to reach commuters.

— Shape, size and scale  
Take up a minimum ‘footprint’ (floor area) of 10\\’ x 20\\’. Consider how viewers will approach it, move around and through it. Can you take advantage of different viewpoints? Can you use objects or materials in an unusual way to catch attention? Is the scale right? Context is critical: make sure your project stands out from its surroundings.

— Longevity  
Life-span can be anywhere from one day to three months. How long should your project exist and why? Is its longevity related to its message?

— Media  
Your solution must feature a physical 3-d installation. However you are also free to include additional media to create an effective solution; i.e. sound, screen interaction, print, etc.

— Sustainability  
Your proposed materials and design approach should be as sustainable as possible. I will present information on sustainable practices in class.

#### LEARNING OBJECTIVES

— Develop a sense for designing and communicating in three-dimensional space  
— Learn about interactivity and engaging your audience  
— Learn how to integrate sustainability into your thinking and your working methods  
— Collaborate effectively as a team, getting the best out of each team member  
— Push beyond your comfort level, and have a good time doing it

#### DELIVERABLES

Teams will submit a set of printed sheets and a presentation PDF. Printed sheets should be 11 x 17\\\\\\” horizontal format. A short video is suggested but optional.

Printed sheets must include:  
— Several site photos showing how the site looks currently.

— A floor plan, showing how your installation/exhibition sits in context. Include key measurements within the plan, local references (for example surrounding streets or landmarks if it is outside). Include the scale in a lower corner.

— Photographic visualizations (at least 5). These can be Photoshop visualizations using photos of your site, and/or you can create and then photograph props or a dimensional model. You are welcome to use Sketch Up or other 3-d visualization programs.

— A series of details showing sections of your design close up (large enough for relevant text to be legible).

— You can include physical materials and mock-ups, to show the tactile quality of your piece.

— Printed pieces or other collateral can be handed in loose with your printed sheets.

— All team members’ names should appear small, in a consistent location on all sheets

#### REFLECTIONS

The students struggle to visualize effectively in 3-d. Tutorials in Sketch Up or similar may help. Ideally teams include both a graphic designer and an industrial/3-d designer.
