### Most layouts look best when at least two fonts are used to set text. 

Magazine spreads, book pages, flyers, websites, and other text-based designs will always benefit from a well-chosen font pairing. But if you’ve never paired fonts before, where to begin?

This guide shows you five easy ways\* to create a failsafe font combination every time and suggests appropriate ways to use each font pairing style. Read on to find your font dream team…

*\* These five font pairings are based on using one font for the headline (the main title on your page) and another font for the body text (the longer paragraphs which make up the bulk of content on your page). If you want to add sub-headings or pull-out quotes, setting text in an italic weight is always a wise move, or try using a bold or condensed version of your body text font to add contrast while keeping the typography looking polished.*

### **1. Sans Serif Headline + Serif Body Text**

This is the most common font pairing style designers will use when they want to make their typography look instantly more polished and professional. Why does this font pairing work so well? 

1. The pairing has high contrast, which creates interest and stimulates the eye. 
2. This pairing feels at once both classic and contemporary, making it suitable for all sorts of layouts.
3. Bookish serifs tend to be easy to read, while sans serifs add a more modern, sophisticated flourish, making it functional and stylish.

Within this font pairing style, you’ll find that certain sans serifs look better teamed with particular serifs. Start by choosing a headline sans serif you love and experiment with serif options for body text.

One of our favorite font pairings is headlines set in [Bebas Neue](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bebas-neue) with body text set in [Caslon](https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/adobe/adobe-caslon-pro). A sub-heading set in [Adobe Caslon Pro Italic](https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/adobe/adobe-caslon-pro) adds the perfect finishing touch.

### **2. Headline + Body Text Fonts From the Same Font Family**

Most fonts belong to a typeface family—a group of fonts that vary in weight (e.g., **bold**, *italic*, book, etc.) but ultimately share the same base design. Superfamilies include even more stylized variations, such as condensed or expanded styles.

Pairing fonts from the same family is a quick route to creating a cohesive and elegant design. This pairing calms the eye, perfect for more traditional or formal layouts.

We love the combination of a [Roboto Slab](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto-slab) headline with [Roboto](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto) body text. The different weights offer plenty of variation to keep designs playful.

### **3. Headline + Body Text Fonts Which Share the Same Mood**

Every font carries a personality. Designers often group fonts that evoke a similar "mood" or "vibe." This professional concept makes pairing easier.

Examples include:
- Old Style Serifs (e.g., [Bembo](https://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/bembo)) paired with Humanist Sans Serifs (e.g., [Gill Sans](https://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/gill-sans)).
- Transitional Serifs (e.g., [Mrs. Eaves](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/mrs-eaves-ot/)) with Geometric Sans Serifs (e.g., [Futura](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura/)).
- Modern Serifs (e.g., [Bodoni](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/atf-bodoni/)) with Geometric Sans Serifs.

### **4. Display Headline + Humanist or Transitional Body Text**

Display fonts are designed to grab attention and look incredible when paired with subtler body text like Humanist or Transitional styles.

An excellent example: [Scala Sans Black](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-scala-sans/) headlines paired with [Gentium Basic](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/gentium-basic).

### **5. Round Sans Serif Headline + Old-Style Serif Body Text**

Rounded sans serifs offer a youthful, modern vibe. Pairing them with a traditional serif creates a striking contrast.

For example, [Quicksand](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/quicksand) headlines combined with [Garamond](https://typekit.com/fonts/adobe-garamond) create a futuristic yet clean design.
