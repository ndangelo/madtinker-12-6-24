In addition to the work assigned on the last post complete the following.

- 5 impromptu or informal videos posted with quality taglines.
- 2 animated gifs that “mesh” with the facebook interface. Where does the Facebook post start and stop? Be creative!
- 10 more photographic posts with branded copy.
- One formal video that you will plan in class today. It should be produced by Friday. Check d2l for the exact time.

Remember: Our guest lecturer [Kevin McElroy](https://www.kevinmcelroy.com/) will be viewing your pages before his lecture. I can’t wait to look at your work with him this weekend!
