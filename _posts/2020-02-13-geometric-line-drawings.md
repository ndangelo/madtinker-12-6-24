- Create and build multiple shapes within it.
- Create intersecting points.
- When you have completed your finished drawings and they have been approved, use three colors to accent some of the shapes.

Before you start the above projects, create small sketches first. Use two pages in your sketchbook. Quarter each sheet. Draw a sample drawing similar to the above directions.
