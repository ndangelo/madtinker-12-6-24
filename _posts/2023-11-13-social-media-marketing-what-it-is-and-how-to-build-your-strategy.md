## **Assignment: Social Media Campaign**

Use the following guidelines to create your own social media campaign for your business. Include the following in your campaign.

**You must use adobe express’ calendar functionality to post at least one post a day from 11-21-24 till the end of finals week. Done properly this can be completed in advance. Simply date the time you wish a post to post!**

You will create a unified campaign that spans **Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter and Tiktok.**

It could be:

- **Scavenger hunt (with an incentive)**
- **Special Deal**
- **NonProfit (specific event)**
- **or more**

Users should be led from one social media format to another – and then perhaps a location? Who knows?

This campaign must include:

- **1. Five Facebook posts.** Two with a professional-looking advertisement. (You can use Adobe CC or Spark.
- **2.** **A formal video ad.** – a commercial in Facebook and Instagram – storyboards are needed (Spark is perfect for this)
- **3.** **One picture post.** (All Platforms)
- **4. Two text-only posts** to X (twitter)
- (text should be included with all posts for all platforms.)
- **5. Instagram: Professional Advertisement.** (All Platforms)
- **6. Four other “behind-the-scenes pictures”** of your business that people don’t normally see. (All Platforms)
- **7. Five Tiktok or video posts on other social media platforms**. Informal but with a professional “resolve” frame at the end of each
- **8. All these posts need to lead toward your goal.**
- **9. Hashtags!** Use them liberally in the post. See presentation.
- **Create ten 20 #hashtags for your brand.**
- **Create ten hashtags for your campaign.**
- **Incorporate these hashtags in all your social media platforms.**

**Remember the following:**

- **1. Be true to your brand**. Each of your campaigns reflects your brand identity and values.
- **2. Stay focused**. Each campaign has a single, simple message at its core.
- **3. They’re trackable.** Each campaign has a distinct hashtag or channel, which means the companies can measure key indicators of success.
- **4. They’re unique to each platform.** Broadcasting identical content across every platform is less effort for your social media team, but it looks sloppy.
- **5. They’re timely.** Every campaign should be responsive to current events and activities
- **6. They’re emotional.** Be memorable, people should make you feel something when you see them.
- **7. Be original. It would be be**st never to imitate someone else’s successful idea.
