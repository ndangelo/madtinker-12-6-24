**Once you’ve completed your document, you can proof it in a similar way to how you would proof a Word Document, but there are additional tools to help ensure you have a perfected technical finish to your document too.**

You can conduct a **word-count, character-count, paragraph-count and line-count** using the **<span style="color: #993366;">Info Panel</span> (Window &gt; Info)**. Highlight the text to generate the counts.

To conduct a spell-check go to **Edit &gt; spelling &gt; Check spelling** to view highlighted errors. The **Check spelling** window will give you possible corrections for each error, and invite you to **Change** or **skip** them. When you’re finished, click **Done**.

Before you export your document to print you should perform a **Preflight** to highlight any potential technical errors in your document. InDesign will alert you of any **Preflight** errors when you go to **Export** to PDF, but the best thing to do is open the <span style="color: #993366;">**Preflight**</span> **<span style="color: #993366;">Panel</span>** before exporting and go over the errors in detail.

Common errors are **missing fonts, text overflowing frames** and **missing links.** These will be flagged up in **<span style="color: #993366;">red</span>** in the **Preflight Panel**. You can click the arrow next to the listed error to view more details. Ensure these problems are resolved before you go to export your document.

**TOP SKILLS TIP:** Before you even finish your document InDesign can help you avoid spelling errors as you work. You can enable **Dynamic spelling**, which underlines potential spelling mistakes as you work, by setting your **spelling Preferences**. Go to **Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; spelling (Windows) or inDesign &gt; Preferences &gt; spelling** (Mac OS) and check **Enable Dynamic spelling**.
