At the very least, you need to include these three things on your sheet:

1. Your logo.
2. Color palette with Hex numbers.
3. Primary and secondary fonts.

## Why you need a brand style guide. 

Regardless of whether you’re a one-woman shop or have a team and are growing every day, it’s a good idea to have a brand style guide. Below are four reasons it will make your life easier and ensure you stay on-brand as you grow:

1. Make sure your branding elements look good together.
2. Make sure team members use the right fonts and colors, so your branding stays consistent.
3. Ensure outside contractors (videographers, designers, etc.) get your look and vibe, so you don’t miss the mark when creating new material.
4. Use internally as a guide when developing new programs or products to make sure all of your offerings look cohesive so you can continue to build brand recognition.

As you can see, it may take a few minutes to put your brand style guide together, but it will save you time and headaches as you grow your business.
