### In a digital age, print ads still have value.

Even today, not all advertisements are displayed on screens. In a world where it’s more difficult than ever to differentiate your brand, print advertising campaigns are a successful way to increase brand awareness. With magazine ads, posters, flyers, and billboards, you can revitalize your brand in the eyes of consumers by bringing it into the physical world and making sure that they remember you as a reliable source.

### Why print ads are important.

Print advertisements provide a level of clarity, intrigue, and memorability that is unmatched by digital advertising because their copy and design are succinct and appealing. When compared to when it is viewed digitally, ad recall is 2.6 times higher when it is in print. Nearly the same factor also improves the advertisement’s clarity for the consumer. Additionally, consumers are almost three times more likely to find a print advertisement interesting than a digital one.

### Prior to creating your print ads.

An advertising agency frequently creates print ad campaigns (You). Create a strategy for reaching your target audience before deciding how your print ads will fit into the overall context of your marketing plan. A creative director, whether on your team or at a different agency, can assist in presenting ideas that fit within the overall visual identity and personality of your business. Your internal teams or contracted agencies will follow your brand guidelines when creating print advertisements if you have a distinct brand identity for your company and a brand kit.

### Items that make up a print advertisement.

A **background image** (The main part of your advertisement), illustrations or graphics, your company name and logo, any pertinent contact information, body copy, a tagline, and a compelling call to action are the fundamental components of a creative advertisement.
