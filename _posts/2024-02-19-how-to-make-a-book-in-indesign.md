**The following are basic instructions. They should only be used to help your creative process. This tutorial is only to assist you build the book cover. Your book cover will be personalised. Use your imagination! Have fun!**

You will be creating a book cover and the contents of the book. The cover is the first assignment and should be treated separately.

Come up with an idea for a book. Do you wish to create a fictional text? Or would you rather choose an existing book? If you choose an existing book, pick a text written during the first half of the 20th century.

</div></div>In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to make a dust jacket for a book. Designing book jacket covers can be intimidating. Today, I’ll show you how to set up a dust jacket template that you can reuse repeatedly. Using the Page Tool, we will set up every section of the jacket as its page. This will make the jacket design template easy to alter.

I’ve also included a handy diagram to show you the dimensions and the structure of the book jacket design. Use this as a guide for your future custom book covers and book jackets!

## **What You’ll Need**

## 1. How to Set Up the Structure of a Book Jacket Template in InDesig**n**

We will start by setting up the InDesign book template with one page for this tutorial. Later, on the **Layers** panel, we will set up the rest of the structure of the book jacket template, as shown in the diagram below.

Each part of the book cover template will be set up as its own page. Users will then be able to resize the book jacket cover as they need.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Diagram of the book jacket template](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/32733/image/18-12-RT-Book-jacket-diagram.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Remember: This is your Design</figcaption></figure></div>### **Step 1**

In **InDesign**, go to **File &gt; New**. Name the document *Book Jacket Template* and set the file to the following dimensions:

- **Width** to **6.375 in**
- **Height** to **9.25 in**
- **Orientation** to **Portrait**
- **Units** to **Inches**
- **Pages** to **1**
- Uncheck **Facing Pages**
- **Margins** to **0.5 in**
- **Bleed** to **0.125 in** (it’s best to seek your professional printer’s preference)

Click **Create.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![setting up the book jacket template](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/32733/image/18-12-RT-Book-jacket-templ-1-1.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Remember: This is your Design</figcaption></figure></div>### **Step 2**

On the **Pages** panel **(Windows &gt; Layers),** uncheck **Allow Document Pages to Shuffle** from the main menu. This option will allow us to move pages on the InDesign book template easily.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![on the pages panel select the allow document pages to shuffle](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/32733/image/18-12-RT-Book-jacket-templ-1-2.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Remember: This is your Design</figcaption></figure></div>### **Step 3**

On the **Pages** panel, add four pages to the book jacket template through the **Create New Page** button. Also on the **Pages** panel, drag the pages into a five-page spread.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![create 4 new pages on the pages panel](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/32733/image/18-12-RT-Book-jacket-templ-1-3.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Remember: This is your Design</figcaption></figure></div>### **Step 4**

Select the **Page Tool (Shift-P)** from the **Tools** panel. Select the first page on the left and head over to the **Control** panel. Set the **Width** to **3.5 in.**

Select the last page on the right with the **Page Tool (Shift-P)** and set the **Width** to **3.5 in**. Use the **Page Tool (Shift-P)** to move the pages next to each other if necessary.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![select the back and front lap and resize](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/32733/image/18-12-RT-Book-jacket-templ-1-4.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Remember: This is your Design</figcaption></figure></div>Advertisement

### **Step 5**

On the **Layers** panel, select the spine section of the book jacket cover and head over to **Layout &gt; Margins and Columns.** Set the **Margins** on all sides to **0.25 in.** Click **OK.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![alter the margin on the spine ](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/32733/image/18-12-RT-Book-jacket-templ-1-5.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Remember: This is your Design</figcaption></figure></div>### **Step 6**

Select the **Page Tool (Shift-P)** from the toolbar. Select the spine page and set the **Width** to **1 in.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![change the size of the spine](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/32733/image/18-12-RT-Book-jacket-templ-1-6.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Remember: This is your Design</figcaption></figure></div>### **Step 7**

Before we start the design of the InDesign book template, we need to alter the margin settings on the *front cover* and *back cover.* We need to subtract 0.375 in order to have the design aligned in the center.

On the **Layers** panel, select page 2 of the InDesign book template. Head over to **Layout &gt; Margins and Columns** and set the **Left** margin to **0.875 in.** This is to account for the 0.375-inch back wrap and the 0.5-inch margin on all sides.

Repeat the same procedure on the *front page* of the book jacket cover*.* On the **Layers** panel, select page 4. Head over to **Layout &gt; Margins and Columns** and set the **Right** margin to **0.875 in.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![move the margins on the front and back cover](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/32733/image/18-12-RT-Book-jacket-templ-1-7.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Remember: This is your Design</figcaption></figure></div>## 2. How to Set Up **Parent Pages, Swatches, and Styles**

### **Step 1**

Open the **Layers** panel by going to **Window &gt; Layers.** We’ll organize our book cover template into three layers so that users can edit the content.

Bring up the **Layers** panel by going to **Window &gt; Layers.** Double-click on **Layer 1** and rename it **Background.**

In the **Layers** panel main menu, select **New Layer.** Name it **Text.** Click **OK**. Also create a new layer named **Images.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![create new layers](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/32733/image/18-12-RT-Book-jacket-templ-2-1.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Remember: This is your Design</figcaption></figure></div>### **Step 2**

Head over to **Window &gt; Color &gt; Swatches** to expand the **Swatches** panel. Choose **New Color Swatch** button from the main menu. Set the **Swatch Name** and values to the following:

You will create swatches for your book cover when you have completed it’s general design.

- **Blue: <s>C=100 M=80 Y=20 K=55</s>**
- **Orange:** **<s>C=0 M=75 Y=95 K=10 </s>**
- **Sand:** **<s>C=10 M=13 Y=15 K=0</s>**
- **Yellow: <s>C=5 M=25 Y=55 K=0</s>**

Click **Add** and **OK** after you input each of the color values.

<div class="wp-block-cover aligncenter"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim-0 has-background-dim"></span>![create swatches](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/32733/image/18-12-RT-Book-jacket-templ-2-2.jpg)<div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow">**FPO**

</div></div>You will create your own styles when you have established a paragraph appearance.

### **Step** 

<s>For this custom book cover tutorial, I created a list of **Paragraph Styles** that you can use to format the book jacket template. </s>

Head over to **Window &gt; Styles &gt; Paragraph Styles** to open the **Paragraph Styles** panel. In the main menu, select **Load Paragraph Styles.**

<figure class="wp-block-image">![load paragraph styles](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/32733/image/18-12-RT-Book-jacket-templ-2-3a.jpg)</figure>Navigate to the *Book Jacket Paragraph Styles* InDesign document and click **Open.**

In the **Load Styles** window, click on **Check All** and click **OK**. You’ll have a list of styles on the **Paragraph Styles** panel ready to be used on your custom book cover template.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![paragraph styles panel](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/32733/image/18-12-RT-Book-jacket-templ-2-3b.jpg)</figure>## 3. How to Design a Book Jacket Template in InDesign

### **Step 1**

Bring up the **Rules** on your custom book cover by pressing **Command-R.** Using the top ruler, create two guides horizontally. Sit both on the **Y axis** at **1 in** and **2.75 in.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![create two horizontal guides](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/32733/image/18-12-RT-Book-jacket-templ-3-1.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Remember: This is your Design</figcaption></figure></div>### **Step 2**

In the **Layers** panel, select the **Background** layer.

Head over to the toolbar and select the **Rectangle Tool (M).** Draw a rectangle to cover all of the book jacket template, making sure it is touching the bleeds.

In the **Layers** panel, lock the **Background** layer and select the **Images** layer.

</div></div>### **Step 4**

In the **Layers** panel, select the **Text** layer.

Select the **Text Tool (T) and create a text frame that fits the width of the back flap. Place this text frame under the second guide.

Using the **Paragraph Styles** panel, style the text with the **Flap – Quote, Copy,** and the **Flap – Signature** style.

<div class="wp-block-cover aligncenter" style="min-height:510px;aspect-ratio:unset;"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span>![add text to the back flap](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/32733/image/18-12-RT-Book-jacket-templ-3-4.jpg)<div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow">**FPO**

</div></div>### **Step 5**

Using the **Text Tool (T),** create three text frames on the back cover. These frames will house a quote, copy, and some information in small text.

Set the text to the Back Cover – Quote and Copy styles using the Paragraph Styles panel.

For the bottom text, set the frame to the **Back Cover – Quote.** Head over to the **Control** panel and set the **Type Size** to **8 pt.** In the **Swatches** panel, set the color to the **\[Paper\]** color.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![add text to the back cover](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/32733/image/18-12-RT-Book-jacket-templ-3-5.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Remember: This is your Design</figcaption></figure></div>### **Step 6**

Select the **Rectangle Tool (M)** from the **Toolbar.** Create a rectangle to include the barcode if necessary. Place this item on the **Images** layer.

</div></div>### **Step 7**

Using the **Text Tool (T),** create a text frame outside of the spine. Add the book title and format it using the **Spine** style from the **Paragraph Styles.**

Select the second word and head over to the **Control** panel. Set the **Font** to **Kaydens Script**, and set the **Size** to **38 pt** and the **Baseline Shift** to **-5 pt.**

In the **Swatches** panel, set the color to **Yellow.** Using the **Rotate Tool (R),** rotate the text frame **-90°** and place it along the spine.

</div></div>## 4. **How to Export a Book Jacket Template for Printing**

Before exporting the book jacket template for printing, it’s useful to take a look around all the edges. This is to make sure all the images and vectors bleeding out are touching the bleeds. I advise you to consult your printer for any specific settings.

### **Step 1**

To export the file, go to **File &gt; Export.** Name the file ***Book Jacket Template*** and choose **Adobe PDF (Print)** from the **Format** dropdown menu. Click **Save.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![export the file as an Adobe PDF Print](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/32733/image/18-12-RT-Book-jacket-templ-4-1.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 2**

In the **Export Adobe PDF** window, set the **Adobe PDF Preset** to **Press Quality.** Under **Pages,** set the **Export As** option to **Spreads.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Set the preset to Press Quality and Export As Spreads](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/32733/image/18-12-RT-Book-jacket-templ-4-2a.jpg)</figure></div>On the left side of the panel, select **Marks and Bleeds.** Check **All Printer’s Marks** and **Use Document Bleed Settings.** Click **Export.** You will have a ready-to-print PDF file.

</div></div># How to Make a Book in InDesign: Part 2

**The following are basic instructions. They should only be used to help your creative process. This tutorial is only to assist you build the book cover. Your book cover will be personalised. Use your imagination! Have fun!**

In this article, you’ll learn how to make a book in InDesign. Creating your InDesign book doesn’t need to be daunting or difficult once you know a few basics. In this tutorial, you’ll find all the steps and everything you need to create a book in InDesign.

There are ten essential steps for creating your InDesign book templates from scratch, including how to create a book cover and how to make a book layout. You’ll also pick up some handy tips from the pros.

## 1. The Book

For many first-time book designers, it might also be the first time you come into contact with **Adobe InDesign**, so brush up on the basics before you begin designing so you can confidently approach creating your book.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">[![indesign](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/32534/image/InDesign.jpg)](https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html)</figure></div>For book traditionalists and enthusiasts, print books still hold a huge amount of appeal. The most common and cheapest print format is the paperback (or softcover), which is the best-value choice for self-publishers. Several print-on-demand sites, like [Blurb](https://www.blurb.com/) and [CreateSpace](https://www.createspace.com/), have sprung up in response to demand from self-publishers and independent publishing houses who want to create and sell paperbacks online.

The ‘shelf appeal’ of hardbacks helped publishers to sell large-format titles in record quantities last year, which makes this more old-school print format one to watch.

Hardbacks are more expensive to print but sell at a higher price point too. Check out this tutorial on how to create a hardback cover tailored to a young adult audience:

## 2. Design Your Book to a Standard Size

If you’re planning on selling your book online or distributing it to bookstores, it’s in your interest to design your book to an industry-accepted size.

<div class="wp-block-cover aligncenter" style="min-height:717px;aspect-ratio:unset;"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span>![moby dick cover mock up](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/32534/image/Moby-Dick-mock-up.jpg)<div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow"> **FPO**

</div></div>### US Standard Book Sizes

- Pocket Book: 4.25 in by 6.87 in
- Digest: 5.5 in by 8.5 in
- US Trade: 6 in by 9 in
- Hardcover: Ranges from 6 in by 9 in to 8.5 in by 11 in

### UK, Europe and Worldwide Standard Book Sizes:

- A-Format: 178 mm by 111 mm
- B-Format: 198 mm by 129 mm
- Demy: 216 mm by 135 mm
- Royal: 234 mm by 156 mm

## 3. Understand a Little About Paper Stock

Paper stock is the type of paper the pages of your book will be printed on. The ‘stock’ combines paper finish (such as coated or uncoated) and weight (measured in **‘Grams per Square Meter’, GSM**).

The heavier the paper stock you choose, the heavier your book will be, and the width of the spine will therefore be greater. While an experienced printer can advise you on the best sort of paper stock for your project, you need to know how this will affect the spine width of your cover so that you can accommodate this in your design.

Once you know your book’s paper stock and page count, you can either ask the printer for the spine width or use an online spine width calculator, like this [Gutenberg calculator](https://www.gutenberg.com.mt/spine-width-calculator).

## 4. Learn How to Typeset Your InDesign Book Template

Typesetting is the process of arranging text on the inside pages of a book. Some book designers choose to specialize in typesetting, as the process of typesetting can be very skillful and time-consuming.

However, this isn’t to say that you can’t learn how to typeset your books. This tutorial provides a good overview of the basics of typesetting books in InDesign:

Once you know the basics of typesetting, you’ll also need to develop a good eye for spotting fonts that are suitable for typesetting. Most typesetters tend to opt for tried and trusted serif typefaces. Here are a few pointers to help you choose typesetting fonts which will always work beautifully.

Look out for fonts which are:

- Clear and legible, and readable at a small point size.
- Easy on the eye, with few stylistic ‘quirks’ (these can tire the eye).
- Available in a wide range of weights and styles, such as Book, Roman, Italic, Bold and Black, to give you plenty of flexibility.
- Beautiful and have a classic, familiar feel to them ([a serif like Gorgeous](https://elements.envato.com/gorgeous-serif-font-YEVHBWM) is a great crowd-pleaser for setting body text).

## 5. Get Inspired and Think Creatively for Your Book Cover Design

Walk into any bookstore, and the sheer creativity and diversity of book cover designs will blow you away. Readers do judge books by their covers, so it pays to think creatively and strive to design a book cover that catches the eye and entices a prospective reader to pick up your book.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized">[![placeit cover](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/48/posts/32534/image-upload/horror_book_cover.jpg)](https://placeit.net/editor/horror-book-cover-template-537)</figure></div>You can find great inspiration from sources online, such as [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/), which is flooded with inspiring book design images, or the amazing [Book Cover Archive](http://bookcoverarchive.com/). Sites like these can give you ideas for the theme, mood, fonts, and color palette you might want to use in your design.

These tutorials will guide you through the basics for creating your book covers, as well as give you a few pointers for designing genre-appropriate covers:

## 6. Make Use of Parents

By placing elements such as page numbers and chapter headings on **Parents**, you can apply these elements consistently and quickly to a large number of pages.

Parent pages can be accessed from the **Pages** panel **(Window &gt; Pages)** in InDesign.

In this example, I’ve created three different parent spreads for the inside pages of a book in InDesign­: a ‘Title’ parent for the opening pages of the book with no page numbers, a ‘Start of Chapter’ parent with page numbers but no running headers, and a ‘Chapter Body’ parent with page numbers and running headers along the top of each page.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![parents](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/32534/image/Master1.jpg)</figure></div>Once you’ve set up and applied parents to your book, you will also need to get familiar with the process of threading text throughout your document. Read up on how to do this with this quick tip tutorial:

## 7. Create a Book File and Section Your Book

InDesign offers you a really useful feature for creating long book documents—these are called **Book Files**. A Book File is a collection of grouped documents (usually chapters).

There are several advantages to creating a Book File rather than simply creating your book as one large InDesign document:

- Firstly, you can share styles across the chapters within the Book File and the page numbering sequence will continue from one chapter to the next.
- You can also make changes to your book more quickly and easily when you use a Book File. Instead of opening a single file with a large number of pages, you can open only the section or chapter you would like to edit, which makes navigating through your book much easier.

To create a Book File, go to **File &gt; New &gt; Book** in InDesign. You’ll be prompted to give the book a name and to save it.

When you’ve created the Book File, choose **Add Document** from the **Book** panel’s main menu. From here, you can add InDesign files to the book, which would normally be chapter files (e.g. Chapter 1, Chapter 2, etc).

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![book file](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/32534/image/Book%20file.jpg)</figure></div>Once you’ve set up a book file, it’s important to set up the page numbering of your book correctly. This can be a bit fiddly, so let’s look at an example.

Here, I want to set up my book so that page 1 begins on the first page of the opening chapter. So I select the opening chapter page (which is currently page 13) and choose **Numbering &amp; Section Options** from the panel’s main menu.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![numbering options](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/32534/image/Numbering1.jpg)</figure></div>In the **New Section** window, I check **Start Page Numbering at**, and set this to **1**. From the **Style** menu below, I choose **‘1, 2, 3, 4…’**, before clicking **OK**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![numbering style](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/32534/image/Numbering2.jpg)</figure></div>I want the first 12 pages of my book to be numbered with Roman numerals. To do this, I select the very first page of the document and again choose **Numbering &amp; Section Options.**

As before, I check the Start Page Numbering and set this to 1. But this time I choose **‘i, ii, iii, iv…’** from the **Style** menu, and click **OK**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![numbering style](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/114/posts/32534/image/Numbering3.jpg)</figure></div>You may also want to add a differently numbered section to the final pages of your book.

As you update the page numbers or add or remove pages in your book, the Book File will update the page numbering throughout all the documents (chapters).

## 8. Prepare Your Book for Printing

This is the last step in this tutorial for how to create a book in InDesign. Once you’ve completed the cover and inside pages of your book, you’re ready to export it for printing.

The standard print-ready file format most printers will request is a PDF.

Go to **File &gt; Export** in InDesign, and choose **Adobe PDF (Print)** from the **Format** menu. Choose **Press Quality** from the **Preset** options to ensure your artwork is exported at a very high quality.

***Top tip:** Export your cover and inside pages as a single pdf file.* Use the “spreads” option when exporting.

**Remember page numbering as stated below.**

## Assignment

1. Create five different parent (master) templates. (Remember, one will be for the table of contents and the other will be for a single page of text.
2. Design Each template. Each one should be unique and have a specific purpose
3. Each parent layer should include images and captions
4. set guides in your parent layers
5. Dynamic numbering is required.
6. A cover spread is required. It should be designed in Photoshop and imported into InDesign (Use a separate InDesign file.
7. A publisher’s logo is required for the spine of the book. Create this in Illustrator and import it into InDesign.
8. 4 Chapters are needed for this project. They must be completed in separate InDesign files.
9. A parent template is needed for start of each chapter.
10. Have fun with this, but remember the alignment of elements on the page. If you complete the parent pages correctly, you shouldn’t have a problem.
