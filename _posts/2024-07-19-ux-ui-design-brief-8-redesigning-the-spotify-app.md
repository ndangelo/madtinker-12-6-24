Today’s design brief is redesigning an existing platform, Spotify’s music app. You will be using ChatGPT to help you create a sitemap and user flow.

You will use the command prompt to gain valuable information to assist you with this project. **You must record the prompts you use and the results in a Google document**.

It is essential to use ChatGPT to create design guidelines for your application. The key to making it work for you is your ability to use the command prompts to take your ideas and enhance them. Advice on Colors, fonts, and even layout can be gained via ChatGPT.

After reviewing the following design brief, we will discuss prompts in this project further. A blog post to assist us in this conversation can be found [here](https://www.nuggetofjoy.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-ui-ux-design-with-25-best-examples-prompt/).

**Client:** Spotify

### Objectives

We aim to redesign the Spotify music app to provide users a richer and more personalized music streaming experience. The app should allow users to onboard, discover new music, create playlists, and easily access their favorite songs. “By 2026, the music streaming market is projected to reach $76.9 billion globally.” – Allied Market Research.*berg*

**Success Metrics to Consider:**

- User engagement metrics, such as the number of songs listened to and playlists created
- User signups and ratings
- The conversion rate for concert ticket purchases through the app
- Number of app downloads and active users

### Target audience

NEEDS  
He likes to create and share his music with others. He wants a platform that allows him to collaborate with other artists easily, share his work, and get feedback from the community. He finds it challenging to get his music noticed in the crowded music industry and struggles to find a platform that caters to independent artists like him.

**Sophia Patel**, 23 | Music Enthusiast  
NEEDS  
She enjoys discovering new artists and attending live concerts. She also likes to create playlists for different moods and occasions. However, she finds it frustrating when she cannot easily find new music recommendations or when she has to switch between multiple apps to listen to different genres.

**Sandra Jenkins**, 28 | Fitness Enthusiast  
NEEDS

She enjoys working out and needs music to motivate her during her exercise routine. She wants a platform that allows her to easily create workout playlists and discover new music that fits her workout style. She finds it frustrating when the music app doesn’t provide enough variety in workout music or doesn’t have features that help her track her fitness goals.

**Requirements**

Please test our existing app with users to understand how the current functionality could be improved. Address their most significant pain point.

- User-friendly interface that allows for easy navigation
- Ability to personalize music recommendations based on user preferences
- Option to create and save playlists
- Feature for offline listening as a more robust offering
- Integration with social media platforms for effortless sharing
- Ability to purchase concert tickets through the app

**Platform**

The app should be compatible with either iOS or Android devices. Pay attention to IOS and Android guidelines.
