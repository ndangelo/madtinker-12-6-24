### DESIGN A TYPE-DRIVEN POSTER

#### **Step 1**

Choose from among:
- Flu prevention  
- Wellness (sources: [webmd.com](https://www.webmd.com) or [prevention.com](https://www.prevention.com))  
- A cable television or web channel featuring old films and TV programs (e.g., TCM or [hulu.com](https://www.hulu.com))

**Research your subject.**

1. Submit your objective in one sentence via the d2l dropbox.  
2. Define the purpose and function of the poster, the target audience, and the key information to be communicated.  

For flu prevention or health and wellness, find an interesting fact and use it as your headline.  
For a film/TV subject, choose a famous line from a classic work, e.g., *“Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.”*

#### **Step 2**

1. Select typefaces that reflect the essence of your subject. Consider handmade or found typefaces, or a mix of both.  
2. Design a **type-driven** poster where typography is the central element. Any imagery should play a secondary role.  
3. Create at least **20 sketches**.

#### **Step 3**

1. Refine your two best sketches.  
2. Use visual hierarchy to emphasize key elements.  
3. Ensure proper spacing between letters, words, and lines.

#### **Step 4**

- Produce the final design solution.  
- Your poster may have either a portrait or landscape orientation.
