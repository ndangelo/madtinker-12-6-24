<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![](https://cloudfront.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Folder-Structure.png)</figure></div>When doing a composite, photoshop can get messy really fast. With multiple backgrounds, foregrounds, adjustment layers, and clipping masks all over the place, it’s a good idea to have them all organized. Before I start each of my composites, I create a folder structure for my layers in Photoshop.

- **Finishing** – Contains all the final touches such as Color grading, Sharpening, Dodge &amp; Burn etc.
- **FG\_Elements** – Holds any foreground elements such as light flares, or smoke that may interact with the main subject .
- **Subject** – Holds the layer of the main subject in the composite.
- **BG\_Elements** – Holds all my background layers and adjustment layers that only need to affect the background layers.
- 

### Step Two: Remove your Subject from the Background

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![graphic](https://cloudfront.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Cutout-800x792.png)</figure></div>This is the foundation of your composite. Your ability to cut your subject cleanly out of the background can make or break your composite. There are many ways to do this procedure in Photoshop; however, my preferred method is to use a fairly new feature available in the most recent edition of Photoshop. Select the layer with your subject, and up in the menu, go to **Select &gt; Select Subject**. Photoshop will work its magic and select your subject for you.

However, this selection isn’t always perfect, and this is where you will need to use the Lasso tool by hitting L on the keyboard to adjust the selection manually. Holding the shift key will add to the current selection when using the Lasso tool. Holding the option (alt) key will subtract from the current selection.

Cleaning up the selection Photoshop made for you is usually the most time-consuming part of the composite. While there are other tools that can be used in this step, like the Pen tool, I find that the Lasso, too, allows me to be very quick and efficient at this step. That said, it still takes me ~30 mins to get a super clean selection that I’m happy with.

Once your selection is made the final part to this step is to go to ***Select &gt; Select &amp; Mask***. In the dialog box, you can adjust the Global Refinements settings to suit your needs; however, the more important step here is in the Output Settings. Ensure that ‘Output To’ is set to ‘New Layer with Layer Mask’ and click Ok.

### Step Three: Add a new Background

Now that your subject is removed from the background, move the new layer to your Subject Folder. At this step, you can now add a new background! It’s important to note a few things, however.

1. Make sure that the perspective of your background matches or is similar to the perspective of your subject.
2. Ensure that the background image’s light complements the lighting on your subject.

If these steps are followed correctly, your composite will feel harmony and look more believable which is the goal in good compositions! At this stage, I also like to add subtle flares and other effects in my FG\_Elements folder. Adding these elements often seems to interact physically with the subject, which adds to the overall believability of the composite.

### Step Four: Add the Finishing Touches

I use this adjustment to adjust the colors of all the layers beneath globally.

### Step Five: Save &amp; Quit
