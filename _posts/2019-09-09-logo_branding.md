## VISUAL IDENTITY

This project calls for a comprehensive visual identity—from its marketing strategy to its deliverables. It demonstrates your ability to be consistent yet creative. This is a difficult and involved assignment. It demonstrates to your potential employers’ ability to formulate a strategy and design concept and follow it through with a visual identity that includes several design applications.

You will need to establish the same basic color **“swatches**” to use with your logo’s. You will establish the color scheme while making your style tile. You will use these colors in the next branding phase.
