Install the font, and you are ready to start.

## 1. How to Set Up a New Photoshop File

### **Step 1**

Let’s start this rave flyer 90s-inspired design. In **Photoshop**, go to **File &gt; New**. Name the document *Rave-Poster.* Set the **Width** to **1270 px** and **Height** to **1600 px**. Set the **Resolution** to **72 Pixels/Inch**. Click **OK**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Create a new Photoshop file](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-1.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 2**

In the **Layers** panel, click on **Create a New Fill or Adjustment Layer &gt; Gradient** to get some rave colors started. In the **Gradient Fill** window, select the **Style** to **Linear** and click on the **Gradient** swatch to set the colors.

Under **Presets,** select the **Foreground to Background** preset. Under **Gradient Type,** set the left color stop swatch to `#00a175` and the right color stop to `#0500e8`. Click **OK.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Add a gradient fill layer with a linear style from color green to blue](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-2.jpg)</figure></div>## 2. How to Create the Background Lights Effect

### **Step 1**

On the **Layers** panel, create a new layer by pressing **Shift-Command-N.**

On the toolbar, select the **Brush Tool (B)**. **Right-click** to set the brush **Size** to **250 px** and select a rounded brush with **Hardness** of **0.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Create a new layer and select the brush tool](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-3.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 2**

We’ll add more rave colors. Using the color codes below, create single brush stamps by clicking on the document.

- Orange: `#ff6600`
- Magenta: `#ff00df`
- Red: `#ff0055`

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Using the brush tool use the colors orange magenta and red and create brush stamps over the new layer](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-4.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 3**

While selecting the same layer, go to **Filter &gt; Blur &gt; Motion Blur.** In the **Motion Blur** window, check the **Preview** box. Set the **Angle** to **-50** and the **Distance** to **1500 Pixels.** Click **OK.**

Feel free to experiment with the settings. Changing the angle and distance will result in different outcomes.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Apply a motion blur filter on the brush stamps to create a light effect](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-5.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 4**

You can repeat this section as many times as you like. Try making the brush size smaller or larger or choosing different rave colors. I added another layer with the same colors to add more dimension.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Repeat the action as many times youd like to create a dynamic background](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-6.jpg)</figure></div>## 3. How to Create the Dust Effect

### **Step 1**

To create the dust effect, we need to create something similar to the steps above. Create a new layer on the **Layers** panel by pressing **Shift-Command-N.**

Select the **Brush Tool (B)** and set the foreground color to `#aeaeae`. **Right-click** to set the Brush options. Set the **Size** to **500 px** and the **Hardness** to **100%.** Brush over the center of the page.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Create a new layer and using the brush tool and a color grey brush over the layer](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-7.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 2**

While selecting the layer with the brush stroke, head over to **Filter &gt; Blur &gt; Motion Blur.** Depending on the **Distance** we set, we will either get a blur that is barely there or one that maintains the original shape we started with. I will maintain the **Angle** of **-50** and set the **Distance** to **531.** Click **OK.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Apply the motion blur filter](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-8.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 3**

To create the dust effect, head over to **Filter &gt; Noise &gt; Add Noise.** Here, we can set the coarseness of the particles. We can always lower the opacity later to create a “barely there” look. Check the **Preview** box to see what the result will be. I will set the **Amount** to **180%** and the **Distribution** to **Uniform.** Click **OK.**

Select the dust particle layer on the Layers panel and lower the **Opacity** to **35%.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Apply a noise filter on the same layer to create the particles and lower the opacity of the layer](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-9.jpg)</figure></div>## 4. How to Edit a Visually Interesting Image

### **Step 1**

Open the [Scenic view of ruins and bronze statue in ancient Pompeii](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h6p5qzn644ofx39v741u3/mask.jpg?rlkey=eyxq73sza2u4gzldwgzzdgczh&dl=1) in Photoshop.

On the **Layers** panel, **double-click** on the **Background** layer to unlock it. The **New Layer** window option will open—rename the layer *Statue.* Click **OK.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Open the statue image from Envato Elements in Photoshop and unlock the layer](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-10.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 2**

On the **Layers** panel, add a **Layer Mask** to the *Statue* layer.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Add a layer mask to the statue image](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-11.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 3**

Using the **Brush Tool (B),** set the foreground color to black. Start by brushing over the outside of the statue—in this case, we want to maintain only the statue to use on the *Rave-Poster* file.

Use the backslash **(\\)** key to see the parts that have been masked.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Mask out the image leaving only the face of the statue](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-12.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 4**

Let’s crop the image to be easily manageable in the *Rave-Poster* file. In the toolbar, select the **Crop Tool (C)** and crop the image to just around the statue. Press **Enter** to proceed.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Crop the image to just around the statue](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-13.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 5**

**Right-click** on the *Statue* layer and select **Duplicate Layer.** Under **Destination &gt; Document**, choose the *Rave-poster* file*.* Click **OK.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Duplicate the layer onto the rave-poster file](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-14.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 6**

Head over to the *Rave-Poster* file. We need to resize and rotate the image. Select the *Statue* layer and press **Command-T** to **Transform.** Go to the option bar, and activate the **Maintain Aspect Ratio** button. Set the **Width** and **Height** to **45%** and the **Rotation** to **-45 degrees.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Resize and rotate the image](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-15.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 7**

The advantage of working with Layer Masks is that we can hide and show parts of them without completely deleting them. In this case, I want to refine the statue by only keeping the face and masking out the neck area. Select the Layer Mask on the *Statue* layer and, using the **Brush Tool (B)** and black as a foreground color, start brushing the parts off. There is no right or wrong.

Here, you can also hide the edges of the photo that are easy to miss when using Layer Masks and duplicating images.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Refine the masking on the statue image](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-16.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 8**

Select the *Statue* layer, *not the layer mask linked to it.* Head over to **Filter &gt; Distort &gt; Wave.** In the **Wave** settings window, set the **Type** to **Square,** which means that the effect will divide the image into squares. Set the **Number of Generators** to **20,** the **Wavelength** to **Min. 817** and **Max. 818, Amplitude** to **Min. 1** and **Max. 2,** and finally the **Scale** to **100%** both **Horizontal** and **Vertical.** Click **OK.**

If the statue covers the dust layer, feel free to enlarge it or move it around so that it’s visible.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Apply the wave filter onto the statue layer](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-17.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 9**

In some cases, images don’t exactly match the background color we are working with, and it’s necessary to find a way to make the image neutral. In this case, we will convert it to Black and White. On the **Layers** panel, click on **Create a New Fill or Adjustment Layer &gt; Black &amp; White.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Add a black and white adjustment layer](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-18.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 10**

If we want to have only the image in black and white, we must create a Clipping Mask. While holding down the **Option** key, hover between the **Black &amp; White** Adjustment Layer and the layer below, and click once you see the arrow pointing down. A Clipping Mask will apply the Adjustment Layer only to the layer underneath.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Create a clipping mask on the black and white layer to be applied only on the statue image](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-19.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 11**

We can adjust the Brightness/Contrast if the poster looks somewhat dull. On the **Layers** panel, click on **Create a New Fill or Adjustment Layer &gt; Brightness/Contrast**. In the **Properties** panel, we can adjust as much or as little as we want. There are advantages to tweaking the Brightness/Contrast this way instead of via **Image &gt; Adjustment.** We can hide and show the layer and tweak the settings with the **Properties** panel.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Add an adjustment layer to tweak the brightness contrast of the overall file](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-20.jpg)</figure></div>## 5. How to Add Text and Use Stylistic Alternates

### **Step 1**

The rave flyer 90s-inspired design is looking great so far. Now it’s time for text. Select the Type Tool (B) in the toolbar and add the text, “SHADES OF ELECTRO FESTIVAL”. Using the **Type &gt; Panel &gt;** **Characters** panel, set the font to **Space Odyssey – Modern Sans Serif,** the **Size** to **140 pt,** the **Leading** to **130 pt,** and the **Tracking** to **40.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Add text using the type tool](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-21.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 2**

The font includes extended features on some letters that expand the width dramatically. In order to access these, you need to keep the **Characters** panel open. You can also access it by going to **Type &gt; Panel &gt; Characters.**

In this case, we will only use some of the alternates to fit the width of the poster. While on the text layer, select the letters **H** and **A,** head over to the **Characters** panel, and click the **Stylistic Alternate** button to use the alternate. Change the color of the text to white.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Using the characters panel activate the stylistic alternate button for the different letters](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-22.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 3**

I changed the alternates of some of the other letters. Feel free to put your own spin on it.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![It is up to you which letters youd like to change to stylistic alternates](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-23.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 4**

Add a few more details such as stages, bands, dates, website, and address. I added the text below, but feel free to create your own version.

- Berkley Danceclub
- Stages
- Funhouse — Disorder
- Nouveau — Ozid
- Thrill — DJ Kitoo
- 04/OCT – 03/OCT/2018
- WWW.WHD.COM
- 23 CARLETON ST. 40933

To rotate the text, create a text layer and use the **Transform Tool** by pressing **Command-T.** Hover over a corner of the text, hold down **Shift**, and drag to achieve an even rotation.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Add a few more text details to the poster to create a visually interesting composition You can rotate text with the transform tool ](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-24.jpg)</figure></div>## 6. How to Save the File for Web

Head over to **File &gt; Save** and save the file as you would normally.

To save a JPEG file for the web, head over to File &gt; Save for Web or Shift-Option-Command-S. Select the file type in which you want to save the document—I am choosing **JPEG**—and set **100** for **Quality**. Under **Image Size**, you can change the pixel size of the image if you have any size constraints.

On the bottom left-hand side, you can see a preview of the size of the file. This is useful when there are size constraints on a website and you need to lower the image’s quality or size.

Click on **Save…** to choose the location in the new window, and click on **Save** again.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Save the image as a jpeg for web](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31359/image/006-3-Abstract-Rave-Poster-25.jpg)</figure></div>## Congratulations! You’ve Finished This Tutorial
