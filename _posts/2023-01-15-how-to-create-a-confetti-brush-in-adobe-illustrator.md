They’re fun to create and play with. As part of “Love Week”, I’m going to show you how to create a wedding confetti scatter brush. This is ideal for beginners as it doesn’t use the Pen Tool.

I’ll then show you how to use the brush to create a simple Graphic Style which can be used to create a stylish plaque or frame within wedding stationery.

If you’re looking for quality pre-made [wedding invitation templates](https://graphicriver.net/tags/wedding?category=print-templates%2Fcards-invites&referrer=search&utf8=%E2%9C%93&view=grid) and [wedding stationery](https://graphicriver.net/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&term=wedding&as=0&referrer=search&view=grid&category=print-templates), you can find them over on [GraphicRiver](https://graphicriver.net/).

## 1. How to Create a Basic Heart

### Step 1

There are many ways to create a heart shape in Illustrator. This is my preferred method as it gives an even shape, and it will introduce you to some handy features in the program.

Using the **Ellipse Tool (L)**, create a circle. Use the **Selection Tool (V)** and **Alt-Drag** the circle to duplicate it so it’s slightly overlapping the original shape.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Create two overlapping circles](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150512/brush1.jpg)</figure>### Step 2

Let’s combine the shapes by using the **Pathfinder** panel (**Window &gt; Pathfinder**). Select both of the shapes and then click on the **Unite** button to make them one shape.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Use Pathfinder to combine the shapes](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150513/brush2.jpg)</figure>### Step 3

The top of the heart is taking shape, so it’s time to form the bottom. You’ve got three anchor points at the bottom of the shape… let’s remove the ones either side of the central lower point using the **Delete Anchor Point Tool (-)**. Mouse over the point you wish to remove with the tool and click it.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Remove two anchor points](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150513/brush3.jpg)</figure>Step 4

The handles for the lowest point are creating an acute angle inwards to the shape. We can’t reverse that, but we can flatten it out.

With the **Direct Selection Tool (A)**, click on the offending point. Along the top of the UI, you’ll see the options for **Anchor Points**. Select the first option, **Convert selected anchor point to corner**.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Flatten the bottom](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150514/brush4.jpg)</figure>### Step 5

With the point still selected, use the **Down Arrow** key on your keyboard to nudge the point down 30 points.

Then with the **Direct Selection Tool (A)**, click on one of the side points. Plug the downward pointing handle bar halfway between the point and the bottom of the heart, making sure that the handle bars are still pointing in the same direction. Repeat this on the other side. This will complete your heart shape.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Complete your heart shape](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150515/brush5.jpg)</figure>## 2. How to Create a Series of Colourful Hearts

Step 1

I’m going to be using a colour process by [Beto Garza](https://tutsplus.com/authors/beto-garza). He creates palettes by creating Blends between two shapes. I highly recommend his [self-portrait tutorial](https://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-portrait-in-a-geometric-style--vector-5992).

So let’s first duplicate the original heart shape in the same manner as we duplicated the circles. Select the heart with the **Selection Tool (V)** and then **hold-Alt-drag** the shape alongside it, with enough space to fit say three further hearts in between.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Duplicate the heart](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150515/brush6.jpg)</figure>### Step 2

Select both hearts and create a **Blend** by going to **Object &gt; Blend &gt; Mark** or using **Control-Alt-B**. You’ll then get several hearts between each of your shapes.

To ensure you’ve got a total of five hearts, keep the blend selected and go to **Object &gt; Blend &gt; Blend Options** and select the spacing of **Specified Steps** and the value **3**, as we want three original shapes on top of the two we have.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Create a Blend](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150516/brush6-1.jpg)</figure>### Step 3

When you look at the **Blend** group in the **Layers** panel, you’ll notice that when you drill into the group you’ll see three elements: the path (the line in which the blend follows) and the two original shapes. You can now select the two original shapes and alter their colours until you’ve got the gradient in colours you wish to use for your confetti. I’ve opted for a pastel pink (`#f2a7cb`) and indigo (`#2e3192`).

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Create the colours you wish](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150517/brush7.jpg)</figure>## 3. How to Arrange the Hearts 

### Step 1

Before we arrange the shapes in a circle-ish shape, let’s release them from the Blend. Select the **Blend** in the **Layers** panel and go to **Object &gt; Expand**. This will turn the Blend into a group of five individual shapes.

Then let’s release the shapes from the group by keeping it selected and going to **Object &gt; Ungroup**. You’ll see the shapes are now ungrouped in the **Layers** panel.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Ungrouping the hearts](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150517/brush8.jpg)</figure>### Step 2

Using the **Selection Tool (V)**, arrange the shapes in a circle… it doesn’t have to be perfect as this will be skewed later on.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Put the hearts in a circle](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150518/brush9.jpg)</figure>### Step 3

Then using the **Free Transform Tool (E)**, rotate each one of the hearts. The effect of the brush is to have the confetti randomised, so having the hearts at different angles plays to this effect.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Rotate the hearts](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150519/brush10.jpg)</figure>### Step 4

Let’s resize the hearts so they’re more randomised. With the **Selection Tool (V)**, select a couple of the hearts. Then go to **Object &gt; Transform &gt; Scale**. I’ve reduced the size to **50%**.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Reduce the size](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150520/brush11.jpg)</figure>I then reduce the size of the other hearts to **40%**, so there is a slight variation.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Reduce the size](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150520/brush12.jpg)</figure>You’ll be left with something similar to the below before we create the brush.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![The heart arrangement](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150521/brush13.jpg)</figure>## 4. How to Create a Scatter Brush

### Step 1

Let’s get creating this brush. **Select All** (**Control-A**) and then open the **Brushes** panel (**Window &gt; Brushes**). Click on the **New Brush** button along the bottom of the panel.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![The Brushes panel](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150522/brush14.jpg)</figure>### Step 2

You’ll be presented with a pop-up window asking which brush you wish to create; select **Scatter Brush** and click on **OK**. You’ll now have the **Scatter Brush Options** window.

Name your brush, and then let’s go through each one of these settings so you know why you’re selecting them.

- **Random**: They’re all set to random, because we don’t want a uniform appearance to the scattered confetti. When selecting this option, you’ll get to set the parameters between specific values.
- **Size**: As I created the hearts rather large, I’m giving the Size a small range and not varying it too much. The reason is that the confetti is not being viewed in perspective.
- **Spacing**: This value is as low as it can be with a small variation. This is because the confetti will appear bunched together.
- **Scatter**: Scatter refers to how much the shapes deviate from the path drawn… I want it relatively tidy.
- **Rotation**: The shapes need to fall in random directions… therefore the rotation is set at both extremes.

Click on **OK** once you’re done.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Scatter Brush Options](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150522/brush15.jpg)</figure>### Step 3

You can now apply your confetti brush to any path you wish… here it is on a straight line.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150523/brush16-1.jpg)</figure>## 5. How to Create a Basic Frame

### Step 1

So let’s use this brush to create a basic graphic. I’m going to add a fancy confetti frame around the names of our fictional couple, Gwen and Karen.

Using the **Ellipse Tool (L)**, draw a circle behind the names so we know that the frame won’t overlap the names. Open up the **Appearance** panel (**Window &gt; Appearance**).

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Add a circle around the names](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150524/brush17.jpg)</figure>### Step 2

Click on the **Stroke** line where it has the brush and you’ll get a dropdown showing you the brushes in your Brushes panel. Select your confetti brush. By default, this will have a **1 pt Stroke Weight**, which you can double check by clicking on the **Stroke** link (which takes you to the Stroke panel settings).

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Applying the brush](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150525/brush18.jpg)</figure>### Step 3

Let’s add more confetti. With the Stroke line highlighted, click into the drilldown menu in the top-right corner and select **Duplicate Item**. This will duplicate all the values and settings in the Stroke line. We’re going to edit this slightly by clicking on the **Stroke** link and changing the **Stroke Weight** to **0.75 pt**.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Change the stroke weight to 075](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150526/brush19.jpg)</figure>### Step 4

Now drag the **Fill** line to the top of the **Appearance** panel and change the fill colour to white. This finishes our frame.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![White fill](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150527/brush20.jpg)</figure>### Step 5

If you want to save this pretty frame for future use, open the **Graphic Styles** panel while the design is selected and click on **New Graphic Style**. This will save it for future use to apply it to other shapes.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Saving the Graphic Style](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/15150527/brush21.jpg)</figure>## Awesome Work, You’re Done!
