### ANALYZING BOOK JACKETS AND MAGAZINE COVERS

### To Start: Find five examples of book jackets that express the spirit or personality of their Contents. Justify your choices.

### BOOK COVER DESIGN SERIES

### Step 1

1. Select three books written by a different author. Read their works. Research them. Make your preliminary selections on the themes of the book. How do they fit together? How do they differ? Be very specific! Example: Your theme shouldn’t be “anger” it should be a specific type of anger.
2. Write a single space half-page single-spaced paper describing your plans for this assignment. Write an objective statement. Define the purpose and function of the problem, the audience for the books, and the information to be communicated.
3. Place all your work in a Word Document. Please upload to D2L by the deadline

---

### Step 2

1. Design **three book covers—one for each writer in your series.** Design front covers and spines.
2. The covers must be similar in style and yet express the individuality of each writer.
3. The logo must appear on each cover in the same position.
4. Produce at **least two sketches** for each jacket that could be expanded into a series format.
5. Your solution may be purely typographic, visually driven or type-driven.
6. Think about the various ways the series could be tied together:
7. Through the use of similar visuals: illustrations, graphics, photographs, typography

### Step 3

### Step 4

1. a. Refine the roughs and create one comp per book.  
   b. The covers should be [8″ × 5″](https://ndangelo.com/book_cover_template.zip), held vertically.  
   c. You may use black and white or full color.
