## **Assignment: Social Media Campaign**

Use the following guidlines to create your own social media campaign for your business. Include the following in your campaign.

You will be creating a unified campaign that will span across **Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.**

It could be:

**Scavenger hunt (with an incentive)**

**Special Deal**

**NonProfit (specific event)**

**or more**

Users should be led from one social media format to another – and then perhaps a location? Who knows?

This campaign must include:

**1. Five Facebook posts.** One with a professional-looking advertisement. (You can use Adobe CC or Spark.

2\. **A formal video ad.** (Spark is perfect for this)

3\. One **picture post.**

**4. Two text only posts.**

(text should be included with all posts.)

**5. Instagram: Professional Advertisement.** (A variation of the one you did on Facebook?)

**6. Four other “behind the scene pictures.” pictures** of your business that people don’t normally see.

**Twitter:**

**7.** Variation of the **Posts you included on Facebook**. (But don’t make them exactly the same. Change the messaging? The color palette?

**Remember the following:**

**1. Be true to your brand**. Each of your campaigns reflects your brand identity and values.

**2. Stay focused**. Each campaign has a single, simple message at its core.

**3. They’re trackable.** Each campaign has a distinct hashtag or channel, which means the companies can measure key indicators of success.

**4. They’re unique to each platform.** Broadcasting identical content across every platform is less effort for your social media team, but it looks sloppy.

**5. They’re timely.** Every campaign should be responsive to current events and activities

**6. They’re emotional.** Be memorable, people should make you feel something when you see them.

**7. Be original.** You should never try to imitate someone else’s successful idea.
