### PROJECT: Composition

#### <span style="color: #993300;">GRAPHIC SPACE: DOMINANT VISUAL VERSUS MULTIPLE VISUALS</span>

➊ **First composition:** Find or take a photograph of an object or person, which will be the dominant visual in the final composition. Then find or take photographs of related images, for example: a person (dominant visual) and subordinate visuals: a suitcase, an umbrella, a puddle, a dog, and a fire hydrant. Convert all the photos into silhouettes.

➋ Build a composition around one dominant visual (using size, shape, color, or value contrast), where all other graphic elements form relation- ships with that dominant visual.

**Example:**

![ment](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2015/03/27194501/ment.jpg)

![basic](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2015/03/27194458/basic.jpg)

➌ **Second composition:** using the same silhouettes, now build a composition where there is no single overtly dominant visual; here relationships are built among several shapes or forms through some unifying principle. No element dominates. In a multiple composition, all movements have equal or close to equal force.

**Example:**

![NonDominant](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2015/03/27193918/NonDominant-1024x559.jpg)

➍ Compare the graphic space in both of these compositions.

### PROJECT Part Two

#### <span style="color: #993300;">MODULAR GRID: PERSONAL OR PRESIDENTIAL HISTORY</span>

➊ Find photographs that commemorate or represent important moments in your own life or in the life of a country’s president. Scan the photos.

➋ Write text that contextualizes or complements the images.

➌ Design a basic modular grid. Grids organize con- tent. First, design a simple three- or four-column grid. Add horizontal flowlines to create grid modules. Grid modules are the individual units cre- ated by the intersection of the vertical column and horizontal flowlines.

➍ Place type or images in a grid module. As a point of departure to learn about the purpose and aesthetic of utilizing a modular grid, do not break the grid modules.

➎ Use the grid for a three-page history.
