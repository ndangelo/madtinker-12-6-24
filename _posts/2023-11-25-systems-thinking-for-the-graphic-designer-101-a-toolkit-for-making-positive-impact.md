#### PROJECT BRIEF

Use [the systems thinking process](https://gumroad.com/l/Akqvt) initially proposed in the book “Design to Renourish” and any design methods (cultural probes, storytelling, user flows/personas, life cycle analysis, etc.) that make sense with your chosen topic and strategies. Document everything. Create a research database for the team you will share throughout the project.

Pick one of these general larger issues below and then propose a specific sub-topic to explore. Go deep into the problem following the Re-nourish systems thinking process to define and create a design solution that ideally is carbon positive. It is best to keep the sub-topic more local or regional. Small bets! The project will be critiqued in a public setting. (Teams of 3)

**Health** *(e.g.) How might we make the Emergency Department waiting room more humane and user-focused?*

**Education**  
*(e.g.) How might we improve education and expand learning opportunities for refugees worldwide?*

**Democracy**  
*(e.g.) How might we design an accessible election experience for everyone? How can we more engage people to vote?*

**Planet**  
*(e.g.) How can we effectively change our consumption habits, keep a high quality of life, and stop global warming?*

**The Goals of Systems Thinking**

- Eliminate waste
- Renourish our planet (reparations for nature)
- Renourish our souls with a beautiful object or service
- Create reciprocity (a gift that creates an ongoing relationship)
- Create with, not for – inclusivity
- Have a purpose, not just profit (improve quality of life)
- Advocacy for marginalized voices (reparations for others)

#### LEARNING OBJECTIVES

**Students will learn during this project:**

- Sustainable Design strategies
- Human Centered Design principles
- New design methods and tools
- The “[Design to Renourish](https://gumroad.com/l/Akqvt)” systems thinking method: 
    - 1. Determine project goals
    - 2. Map out the design problem
    - 3. Brainstorm design outcomes
    - 4. Evaluate each possible project outcome

—

**At the end of the project, students should be able to:**

- Shift their thinking from linear to circular
- Embrace complexity, challenges, tension, &amp; uncomfortableness
- Identify points of intervention in future design projects for systems thinking

#### DELIVERABLES

**At the end of the project, students should deliver:**

- A digital presentation that details out the project goals completed in Step Two from the “[Design to Renourish](https://www.routledge.com/Design-to-Renourish-Sustainable-Graphic-Design-in-Practice-1st-Edition/Benson-Perullo/p/book/9781138916616)” systems thinking method
- A detailed and visually stimulating digital mapping of the design problem completed in Step Two from the “[Design to Renourish](https://www.routledge.com/Design-to-Renourish-Sustainable-Graphic-Design-in-Practice-1st-Edition/Benson-Perullo/p/book/9781138916616)” systems thinking method
- A digital presentation of possible design solutions and the process/methods/tools used to determine which project was the best considering the audience(s) and the planet
- Your final solution implemented in the format and medium that best fits the design problem, audience(s), and planet

#### REFLECTIONS

This project was the first to implement the [Design to Renourish Systems Thinking Toolkit ](https://gumroad.com/l/Akqvt)in higher education. So, by definition it was an experiment. I learned a lot from working through the steps and discussing the readings with the students. One of the biggest takeaways was that the process is confusing as there is a lot of back-and-forth between each step and need for further research in each. *However, as one student put it at the end of the project “it was a good confusion”.*

The students, in general, saw the need for a more holistic view of a design project that includes more considerations for inclusiveness in culture and better regard and care for our natural environment. They saw the systems thinking toolkit as a good guide for them to, at this point, begin that journey to a more informed design practice. They hoped that more projects in their senior year included this level of systems thinking.

When I do this project again, I will give more time in the project for Step Two and Four (Mapping &amp; Evaluating Outcomes), to ensure the students have fully explored mapping the problem(s) and really evaluating each out come deeply through research. I will also prepare a more detailed post-project survey for the students to help recommend ways to improve the assignment and suggest other readings and resources.
