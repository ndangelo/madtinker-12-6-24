## Web design plays quite a big role in the development process

While there are changes and new trends in web design, some practices related to eye movement while exploring websites remain the same. The infographic below illustrates the key viewing pattern that most online consumers adhere to when visiting a website.

The Infographic below is showing important viewing pattern most online consumers tend to follow when visiting a website:

- 69% of users’ time is spent looking at the left half of a webpage,
- users maintain an “F/E” shaped viewing pattern,
- users spend 80% of their time looking at information above the fold or the portion of the web page that doesn’t require any scrolling.

Designers need to know how people use some websites and create a better user experience.  
  
The following infographic provides some key information on and learn how consumers think and behave online.
