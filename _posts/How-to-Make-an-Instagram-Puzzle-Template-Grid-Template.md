## 1. Things to Consider Before Making Your Instagram Photo Grid Photoshop Template 

### Step 1

The most important thing before making your own Instagram template is to determine how your Instagram template will look. Let’s start by selecting the colors! Check out the accounts you like or look at any other designs you find attractive. Keep in mind that your photos must match your color palette.

Once you’ve found your inspiration, we need to create a color palette in Photoshop. To do that, go to **Window &gt; Swatches** and select/add colors with the **Color Picker**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Adding Colors to a Palette](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/36892/image-upload/Adding%20Colors%20to%20a%20Palette.jpg)</figure></div>A color palette will help us to keep the Instagram puzzle in a consistent style—you can choose the photos and design elements by relying on the palette. These are the colors I chose for my template; you can use this palette or any other colors you like.

- `#fcdccf`
- `#fe918d`
- `#f4e7eb`
- `#c1cfd2`
- `#2d2624`

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Creating a color palette for instagram template](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/36892/image-upload/Creating%20a%20color%20palette%20for%20instagram%20template.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

The next important thing to decide is which design elements and photos you will use in your template. Do you want to keep it simple, with only photos and shapes? Do you need posts with text? Once you have decided, we can prepare the elements we want to use. Save all the photos and design elements in one folder to have them at your fingerprints.

## 2. How to Create a Universal Instagram Grid Template Layout

### Step 1

Let’s create a universal and easy-to-use Instagram grid template, which can be used for both planning your posts and creating Instagram puzzles! Press **Control-N** to create a new document and set the size to **3240 x 3240 px**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![creating a new document](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/36892/image-upload/Creating%20a%20new%20document.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

Create a rectangle shape with a size of **1080 x 1080** pixels, and rename the layer **Day 01**. Hold **Shift** and move it to the bottom-right corner of the document.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![creating a rectangle](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/36892/image-upload/creating%20a%20rectangle.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 3

Create eight copies of this shape by pressing **Control-J**, and fill the whole document with these rectangles from right to left. This will help us to plan our Instagram posts. You can also add the **Guides** by dragging the lines from the rulers (press **Control-R** to see the rulers).

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![creating the placeholders](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/36892/image-upload/creating%20the%20placeholders.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 4

To add a color to the background of the post’s placeholder, just **Double-Click** on the layer, then select **Color Overlay** and pick a color from your palette.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![adding color to the placeholder](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/36892/image-upload/adding%20color%20to%20the%20placeholder.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 5

If you want to add the color to the whole template’s background, select all the layers while holding **Shift**, group them by pressing **Control-G**, and then make this group **Invisible**. After that, select the background layer, press **Shift-F5**, and select the color you want to use.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![creating a group and filling the background layer with color](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/36892/image-upload/creating%20a%20group%20and%20filling%20the%20background%20layer%20with%20color.jpg)</figure></div>## 3. How to Place Pictures and Create Design Elements for Your Instagram Puzzle Feed Template PSD File

### Step 1

To place your photo, go to **File &gt; Place**, select the image you want to use, and then place it where you want it to appear. The rulers will help you to see which parts of the template it will take.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Placing the images to the template](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/36892/image-upload/Placing%20the%20images%20to%20the%20template.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

Once you’ve finished placing, rearrange and resize (with the **Control-T** shortcut) elements as you like.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![resizing and re-arranging the photos](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/36892/image-upload/resizing%20and%20re-arranging%20the%20photos.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 3

If you need to crop a photo, select an area with the **Rectangular Marquee Tool** and then press **Delete** to remove the unwanted parts.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![removing the unwanted parts of the document](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/36892/image-upload/removing%20the%20unwanted%20parts%20of%20the%20document.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 4

Feel free to use layer style settings to diversify the final look of your template. For example, here, I added a **stroke layer style to the two bottom** images.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![adding stroke layer style settings](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/36892/image-upload/adding%20stroke%20layer%20style%20settings.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 5

Now let’s add a text or logo layer to our template. Don’t forget to use colors from our palette! This way, the text/logo will fit the style. I’ve added “Look Book 2021” and framed it with a rectangle.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![creating a logo](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/36892/image-upload/creating%20a%20logo.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 6

You can also create a solid shape filled with our palette’s colors and add more text if needed. Notice: when you create Insta-puzzles, try to make all the elements look like independent posts. As you can see, all our Instagram puzzle template elements work well even without the puzzle itself.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![adding shapes and text layer to the instagram puzzle template](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/36892/image-upload/adding%20shapes%20and%20text%20layer%20to%20the%20instagram%20puzzle%20template.jpg)</figure></div>## 4. How to Save an Instagram Puzzle Template as Ready-to-Upload Posts

### Step 1

We are ready to save our Instagram puzzle! **Right-Click** on any layer and select **Merge Visible**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![merging visible layers](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/36892/image-upload/merging%20visible%20layers.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

Select the bottom right square (day 01) with the **Rectangular Marquee Tool** and then go to **Image &gt; Crop**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Cropping the first part of the image](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/36892/image-upload/Cropping%20the%20first%20part%20of%20the%20image.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 3

Save this cropped Image as Puzzle Element 01, and then save all the elements the same way, one by one, from the bottom right corner to the top left corner. Once you’ve finished, you can upload them one by one from Puzzle Element 01 to Puzzle Element 09.
