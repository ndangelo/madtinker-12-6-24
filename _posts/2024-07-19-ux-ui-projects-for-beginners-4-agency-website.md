## UX UI Design Portfolio Project 4: Designing an Agency Website

**Client** Choose any design agency brand of your liking.

**Timeline** TBD

### Objectives

**Create a responsive website that allows an agency to:**  
 • Market who they are, what they do, and what they stand for  
 • Showcase their work **case studies, and awards they have won**  
 • Contacted by potential clients  
 • List available positions and receive job applications

### Platform

Please design a design agency website for desktop and mobile devices. You will design **ALL** pages for this project for both devices.

### Limitations/Specifications

The site must load quickly; hence, any interactions or large imagery must be minimal.

### Target Audience

### Deliverables

- Compile a case study structured like this: **Name of project, date, your role, project type(Concept)**  
     • Research: (Refer to the References provided)  
     • Highlight three enhancements or unique features you have included in the solution that makes the site unique and allows it to stand out from other design agencies  
     • Sketch of conceptual and initial ideas  
     • Wireframes and prototypes of all website and mobile pages  
     ⁃ **Homepage** with work, values, team, and contact us calls to action  
     ⁃ **Our work** with filter by industry, date, and awards 
    - At least two design/advertising projects your agency has completed with case study.
    - These projects should be unique. Either something new for this project or something you have completed for another class.

- ⁃ **About us** with values and team bio
- ⁃ Contact us with a map and form
- ⁃ Careers with a culture section and application form

*These should be both desktop and mobile screens.*

 • **Testing and Results section:** Show your wireframes to 5 people and ask them, using your designs, what they think about them, what they would improve, and an overall rating. Take their feedback, iterate the designs, and have a final round of testing with 5 users. See that you improve your overall rating. If not go back to the drawing board and change your designs and retest.

### UX Portfolio Case Study Sections

1. **Project Title &amp; Subtitle** (A headline and subtitle that indicates the name and goal of the project)
2. **Client/Company/Project type**
3. **Project date** (When did you work on the project)
4. **Your role** (What you were responsible for on the project)
5. **Project Summary/About this Project** (An overview that summarizes the project, goal and results)
6. **The challenge** (What specific problem, user needs, business requirements and/or pain points that the project solves. Were there any technical constraints or business KPIs you had to keep in mind? Who are you users and what are their specific needs)
7. **Solution** (What method/process were used to solve specific problem, user needs, business requirements and/or pain points? How did features address the objectives?)
8. **Results** (Project success metrics, awards, reflections, project next steps and/or lessons learnt)
