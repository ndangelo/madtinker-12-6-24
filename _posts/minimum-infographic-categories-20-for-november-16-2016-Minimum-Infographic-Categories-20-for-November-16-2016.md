**Please note:**

A minimum of <span style="color: #800000;">**20 CATEGORIES**</span> need to be included in your Infographic.

More than one **<span style="color: #800000;">CATEGORY</span>** can be depicted/explained in one chart. It all depends on how you design elements of your main Infographic.

There are many examples of this. One is:

[![cursiveq-freebie-elements-vectors-infographics](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2016/11/27185018/cursiveq-freebie-elements-vectors-infographics-1.jpg)](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2016/11/27185018/cursiveq-freebie-elements-vectors-infographics-1.jpg)

<span style="color: #808000;">**Multiple Categories are depicted above in three graphs**</span>. All three together also create a graphic in itâ€™s own right.

Best,

Nick
