## UX UI Design Portfolio Project 6: Designing a Food App

**Client** OhSoYum

### Objectives

We are looking to create a food delivery app that will allow users to order food from their favorite restaurants and have it delivered to their doorstep. The app will need to be user-friendly, visually appealing and efficient. *“Online food delivery has become a $200 billion global industry, yet there is still plenty of room for growth as people increasingly opt for the convenience of delivery.” – Bloomberg*

**Success Metrics to Consider:**  
- User acquisition and retention rate  
- Order volume and revenue growth  
- User engagement and time spent on the app  
- Positive reviews and ratings

### Target Audience

## Deliverables

• **Onboarding screens—These screens** introduce the app to new users and explain how to use it. They might include a welcome message, an explanation of the app’s features, and instructions on how to create an account.

• **Home screen—This is the main screen of the app that users** see when they open it. It might include a search bar, categories for different types of food, and a list of popular restaurants.

• **Restaurant details screen—When a user selects a restaurant, they are** taken to a screen with more information about that restaurant. This might include the menu, photos of the food, and reviews from other users.

• **Ordering screen** – This screen will allow users to place an order from the restaurant they’ve selected. It might include options for customization, like choosing toppings or specifying dietary restrictions.

• **Payment screen** – After a user has placed an order, they will need to enter payment information. This screen might include options for different payment methods, like credit card or PayPal.

• **Order tracking screen** – Once an order has been placed, users will want to know when it will be delivered. This screen might include real-time updates on the status of the order, like when it’s being prepared, when it’s out for delivery, and when it’s been delivered.

• **Profile screen—This screen will allow users to manage their account information, such as** their name, address, and payment methods. It might also include options for viewing past orders and saving favorite restaurants.
