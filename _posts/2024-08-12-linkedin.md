LinkedIn is the leading social network for professional networking. Unlike social networks like Facebook and Instagram, users visit LinkedIn for professional and career-related purposes. Like Pinterest, user posts often link back to website and blog content, making it an effective way to build brand awareness and drive web traffic for lead generation, nurturing, and sales. But to put LinkedIn to use in your marketing, you’ll need to develop a specific [LinkedIn marketing plan](https://fitsmallbusiness.com/linkedin-marketing-strategy/).

Small businesses have both organic and paid social media marketing opportunities with LinkedIn. Like Facebook Ads, paid ads on LinkedIn can be highly targeted as a cost-effective way to reach your intended audience. Given LinkedIn’s audience and professional networking focus, it’s best for recruiting, software as a service (SaaS), B2B marketing, and educational topics.

Here are some best practices for small business social media marketing on LinkedIn:

- Write original content for LinkedIn that links back to your website content as part of your overall [content marketing plan](https://fitsmallbusiness.com/seo-content-marketing-plan/) and strategy
- Share your blog content in posts to drive web traffic
- Create and join groups for targeted networking
- Increase engagement using short-form video
- Get a paid plan to access direct message marketing on LinkedIn
