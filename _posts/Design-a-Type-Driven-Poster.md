Design a Type-Driven Poster

Choice of subject: Healthier kids or flu prevention

STEP 1  
. Choose from: Healthier kids (http://www.letsmove.gov/) or flu prevention  
(http://www.cdc.gov/flu/). Research your subject.

. In one sentence, write your objective. For example, motivate kids to move more and sit less. Or,  
motivate people to wash their hands more often to avoid spreading germs. Define the purpose and  
function of the poster, the audience, and the information to be communicated.

. Find one interesting fact. Use this fact as the basis for writing a headline.

STEP 2  
. Find typefaces that express the spirit of the subject. Or use handmade or found  
type or a combination of handmade type and a typeface.

. Design a poster that is type driven—that is, type mostly carries the message of the poster. If you use any image, it should play a secondary role to the type- driven composition. 

Produce at least twenty sketches.

STEP 3  
- Choose two of your best sketches and refine them.

- Establish emphasis through a visual hierarchy.

Carefully examine the spacing between letters, among words, and between lines of type. 

STEP 4  
Create a finished solution.  
The poster should be no larger than 14” × 17” when held in portrait or landscape orientation.  
PRESENTATION  
Present your solution mounted with a 2” border all around or display on screen.
