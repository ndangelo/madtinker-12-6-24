Add connections between the screens and share your prototype.

## Learning objectives:

- Learn how to create a prototype in Figma
- Create connections between Frames and Layers
- Present and share your prototype
- Practice switching between Design and Prototyping modes
- Design a slide-out menu to add to your prototype

## Today’s tutorial

### 1. Access the prototyping options

So far in this course, we’ve worked exclusively in the “Design” tab of the Properties panel (the area on the right of the window). Time to click the “Prototype” tab:

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![The prototype tab](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65130e79c72ae8812db3412e/6580ac5a38ed18874a93b01f_F101_D5_01.jpeg)</figure></div>### 2. Rename the Frames in your app flow

Before creating any prototype, ensuring your Frames have distinctive names is a good idea. We’ve given our three screens descriptive titles: “Login Screen,” “Photo Stream,” and “Photo Post.” To rename a Frame, you must double-click its label at the top-left-hand corner of each Frame, type the new name, and hit Enter. You can also rename Frames in the Layers panel on the left.

Good naming conventions are especially important in larger projects—just imagine trying to build a 50-screen prototype if all of your Frames are named some variation of “iPhone SE – Copy 42”!

Prototyping in Figma works by creating links between Frames and elements within Frames. When we present the prototype, the user can click on linked elements to move around the app.

First, we must establish the screen where the user experience (UX) begins. Click on the “Login Screen” Frame you designed in the Layers panel, and you’ll then see the options change in the Prototype tab of the Properties panel on the right. Then click the “+” icon to the right of where it says “Flow starting point” in the Properties panel.

### 4. Create a connection

If we select Frames or specific elements within our Frames while the Prototype tab is open, we get an extra, circular handle on the right-hand edge of every object. This handle allows us to set which screen that object leads to when it is tapped.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65130e79c72ae8812db3412e/6580b349fd5624b348a0ce43_a-signin.jpg)</figure></div>Let’s use this to create a connection. First, select the “Sign In” button in your Login Screen. Then click and hold on that circular handle, and drag an arrow over to the Photo Stream to create a connection. This means that when the user taps the “Sign In” button in our prototype, they will be taken to the “Photo Stream” screen.

<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls="" loop="" muted="" preload="none" src="https://storage.designlab.com/email-courses/figma-101/2023/F101_D5_05.mp4"></video></figure>Once you’ve successfully made a connection, a small pop-up will appear confirming how the interaction will work. Take a peek at the drop-down options here. If you’ve clicked away already, you can reappear this pop-up by clicking on the light blue connect arrow extending from the “Sign In” button to the Photo Stream Frame.

### 5. Create another connection

Let’s repeat the process by linking one of the photos in the Photo Stream to the Photo Post Frame. Simply click on the heron photo and drag the connection handle over to the Photo Post Frame.

<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls="" loop="" muted="" preload="none" src="https://storage.designlab.com/email-courses/figma-101/2023/F101_D5_06.mp4"></video></figure>### 6. Create connections for the “back” button

Repeat this process once more to create a connection from the “Home” icon we created in the nav bar to the Photo Stream page. This is pretty rudimentary functionality, but it will give your users a feel for how they will move around the app.

<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls="" loop="" muted="" preload="none" src="https://storage.designlab.com/email-courses/figma-101/2023/F101_D5_07.mp4"></video></figure>### 7. Set up a “Profile” page

We’ve got time today to create one extra screen. This allows us to practice moving between the Design and Prototype tabs in the Properties panel and get a feel for managing our prototype connections while adding to the app design.

Duplicate your Photo Post Frame by selecting that Frame and hitting ⌘D (Mac) or CtrlD (PC). Did you notice that when you duplicated the Frame, the “home” button connection was also carried across to the new Frame? Any connections that originate from the duplicated Frame will also be copied over. This can save work but also create problems if the connections aren’t updated where necessary.

In this case, we want to keep the one connection from the “Home” button to the Photo Stream page. To remove a link between screens, simply click on the connection arrow and hit Delete on your keyboard.

### 8. Build the “profile page”

It’s time to create a simple Profile page that we’ll eventually connect to the Profile button in the nav bar. Select everything in the duplicate of the Photo Post screen except the wordmark and nav bar, and then delete it. Now, use the skills you’ve gained over the past few days to reproduce the design below.

Notice that several elements are things you’ve already created. They are just resized and edited:

- The profile picture centered at the top comes from the Photo post-screen
- The two buttons are duplicates of the “Sign In” button on the Login Screen
- The three animal pictures are from the Photo Stream

Beyond that, you’ll need text boxes, lines, ellipses, and some columns to help distribute these elements properly. Try this independently, but if you get stuck, check out the sample file linked at the end of today’s tutorial.

### 9. Create connections to the Profile 

The final step is to create connections to the Profile screen:

1. The profile icon button on the Photo Stream, linking to the Profile Frame
2. The profile icon button on the Photo Post, linking to the Profile Frame
3. The home icon in the Profile Frame should already be linked back to the Photo Stream, but it doesn’t hurt to double-check like we did in the video tutorial

You can launch your prototype by hitting the “Present” button at the top-right of the Figma interface. Do this now to check that all your connections are working as planned!

Note that it’s possible to present your prototype in a device container in the latest version of Figma. While in the “Prototype” tab, select “iPhone SE” from the dropdown in the “Device” section. Then, click the “Present” button again! One of the advantages of using a simulation like this is that it gives a more accurate experience of the size and scale of screen elements.

To share your designs as prototypes, copy the link from your browser’s address bar while you’re in “Present” mode and send it via email or instant message. Then, get a friend or family member to try using the prototype.

Voilá, you’re doing user testing! Watch them use the prototype. Do they intuitively know where to click? What ideas does watching them give you for how to improve the design?
