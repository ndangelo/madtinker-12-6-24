### Objectives

We are a property management company specializing in selling and renting residential and commercial properties.

The website should be designed to attract and engage potential customers, focusing on usability, speed, and accessibility.

**Success Metrics to Consider:**

- Increased website traffic and page views.
- Higher engagement rates, including longer visit durations and lower bounce rates.
- Increased property listings from real estate agents.
- Higher conversion rates from homebuyers, including more inquiries and purchases.
