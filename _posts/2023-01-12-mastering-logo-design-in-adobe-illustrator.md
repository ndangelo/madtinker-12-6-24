## 1. Intro to Adobe Illustrator Logo Design

### 1.1 Introduction to Logo Design in Adobe Illustrator

[**Watch Video Lesson (1 min) ↗**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YycxaAK2MZ4)

Ready to explore Adobe Illustrator logo design? In the first half of this course, we’re going to look at the essential tools in Adobe Illustrator that you need as a logo designer. In the second half, we’ll use those techniques to build a logo together. At the halfway point, we’ll pause for a Q&amp;A session, originally held in this course’s livestream.

### 1.2 How to Create a New Document in Illustrator

[**Watch Video Lesson (1 min) ↗**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YycxaAK2MZ4&t=78s)

Let’s begin our exploration of Adobe Illustrator by creating a new document. Follow along with this lesson to get started in the software. Keep in mind that you could change these values to suit your project.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![illustrator logo design](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181400/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_1c-1.jpg)</figure>Need a little help with some Adobe Illustrator basics?

Lines and shapes are some of the core aspects of creating artwork within Adobe Illustrator. In this lesson, you’ll get a feel for how to use them yourself. We’ll start simple, so we can build upon these shapes later.

You can find the **Shape Tools** and the **Line Tool** within the **Tools** panel.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Shape Tools](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181401/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_2b-1.jpg)</figure>Can’t find a specific Shape Tool? **Click and hold** to expand the tools in the **Tools** panel. For example, your Ellipse Tool may be nested under your Rectangle Tool.

### 1.4 How to Use the Pen Tool in Illustrator

**[Watch Video Lesson (5 mins) ↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YycxaAK2MZ4&t=455s)**

The Pen Tool is another Adobe Illustrator essential. In this lesson, you’ll learn how the Pen Tool works. It’s a great way to create custom shapes and curves. You can find the **Pen Tool** in the **Tools** panel.

Don’t worry if you’ve never used it before—this lesson will give you all the ins and outs you need to get started. We’ll create points and customize them too.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Pen Tool](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181402/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_3b-1.jpg)</figure>Want to see more of the Pen Tool in action? You can learn even more about working with the Pen Tool in this free tutorial:

1.5 How to Use the Selection Tools in Illustrator

**[Watch Video Lesson (4 mins) ↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YycxaAK2MZ4&t=750s)**

There are two Selection Tools you should know in Adobe Illustrator: The Selection Tool and the Direct Selection Tool. In this lesson, you’ll learn the difference between the two and see them in action.

### Selection Tool

Use the Selection Tool to select artwork in your workspace, overall.

For example, you could select an entire shape with the Selection Tool.

### Direct Selection Tool

Use the Direct Selection Tool to select points in your artwork.

For example, you could select one point in a shape with the Direct Selection Tool.

Not sure which selection tool to use? Remember to keep an eye on the selection you’ve made in Illustrator (what it has highlighted). Consider the Selection Tool your “main” selection tool.

### 1.6 How to Use the Stroke Panel in Adobe Illustrator

**[Watch Video Lesson (6 mins) ↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YycxaAK2MZ4&t=990s)**

We’ll use the Stroke panel in this lesson to customize our strokes—from the size to the color. You can open the Stroke panel by going to **Window &gt; Stroke**. Ready to give it a try?

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Stroke Panel](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181403/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_4b-1.jpg)</figure>You can change your **Stroke** and **Fill** colors from the **Tools** panel. This is also a quick place where you can turn the Stroke and Fill colors “off” if you don’t want them visible.

## 2. How to Work With Shapes in Illustrator

### 2.1 How to Use the Layers Panel in Adobe Illustrator

**[Watch Video Lesson (2 mins) ↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YycxaAK2MZ4&t=1369s)**

Layers are a powerful part of Adobe Illustrator. They’re going to help us take our logo design even further. Before we dig into using this feature for creative logo design, let’s take some time to explore how layers work—and why you’d want to use them.

Open your **Layers** panel by going to **Window &gt; Layers**. Keep in mind that you can create, delete, duplicate, and hide layers from this panel.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Layers](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181405/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_5c-1.jpg)</figure>Want to learn even more about the ins and outs of Adobe Illustrator layers? Check out these free tutorials:

### 2.2 How to Adjust Transparency in Adobe Illustrator

**[Watch Video Lesson (4 mins) ↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YycxaAK2MZ4&t=1481s)**

Sometimes, you may want to experiment with transparency as you explore creative logo design. In this lesson, we’ll take a look at some ways we can use transparency to create some interesting effects in Adobe Illustrator.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Transparency](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181406/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_6b-1.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Two shapes with no Transparency applied.</figcaption></figure><figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Transparency](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181407/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_7b-1.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lowered Transparency applied to the front shape.</figcaption></figure>### 2.3 How to Use the Path Finder Tool and Shape Builder Tool

**[Watch Video Lesson (8 mins) ↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YycxaAK2MZ4&t=1696s)**

This lesson is all about using our tools to build and manipulate more complex shapes.

The **Path Finder Tool** is used to manipulate shapes. For example, you can unite two selected shapes into one. This tool allows us to quickly and simply combine and subtract different parts of our work.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Path Finder Tool](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181408/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_8b-1.jpg)</figure>Similarly, the **Shape Builder Tool** also allows us to manipulate shapes—but in some regards, makes it even easier! In this lesson, we’ll also walk through how to use this tool to combine and remove parts of compounded shapes.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Shapes](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181409/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_9b-1.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Shapes used to create a cloud shape</figcaption></figure><figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Shape Builder Tool](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181410/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_10-1.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Shapes combined with the Shape Builder Tool</figcaption></figure>You can learn even more about working with the Shape Builder Tool in this free tutorial, right here at Envato Tuts+:

These concepts can be utilized in many different ways. You could, for example, draw an abstract shape with the Pen Tool or achieve a similar result by using the Shape Builder Tool—your workflow, your preferred way.

### 2.4 How to Use Swatches in Adobe Illustrator

**[Watch Video Lesson (6 mins) ↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YycxaAK2MZ4&t=2215s)**

Swatches in Adobe Illustrator are one of the best ways to use, apply, and keep your colors at hand. We’ll look at using the **Swatches** panel in this lesson. This is an important one that we’ll use later in the course, as well. Go to **Window &gt; Swatches** to open up the Swatches panel.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Swatches](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181411/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_11b-1.jpg)</figure>We’ll look at **Global Swatches** in this lesson too—which make changing the colors in your composition even easier!

### 2.5 How to Use Gradients in Illustrator

Gradients, when used properly, can help bring depth to our work. That’s just what we’ll do, once we’re ready to explore how to design a logo in Illustrator. For now, we’ll start off this lesson by exploring how gradients work. Then, we’ll expand upon this with some great ways to use them later in this course.

**[Watch Video Lesson (3 mins) ↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YycxaAK2MZ4&t=2770s)**

Sometimes, you might want to go back and adjust the curve of some of your lines. Thankfully, the **Smooth Tool** makes doing so a breeze. The **Shaper Tool** allows us to quickly draw shapes and interprets them for us. Join me in this lesson, where we walk through how to use these tools to make this process simple for us in our logo design process.

## 4. How to Create a Logo Design

### 4.1 Building the Shape of Our Logo Design

**[Watch Video Lesson (8 mins) ↗](https://youtu.be/YycxaAK2MZ4?t=3748s)**

Now that we’ve taken an in-depth tour of Adobe Illustrator, let’s take what we’ve learned and put it into action. We’ll begin building the overall shape of our logo design.

Take a look at the tools we explored in action, below. There are many ways to achieve these results based on what we learned. Let’s walk through some ways to achieve this together in this lesson.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Stroke](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181420/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_20-1.jpg)</figure><figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Increase Stroke](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181421/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_21-1.jpg)</figure><figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Direct Selection Tool](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181422/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_22-1.jpg)</figure>Want to learn more about the creative logo design process in Adobe Illustrator?

### 4.2 Creating the Shadows

**[Watch Video Lesson (6 mins) ↗](https://youtu.be/YycxaAK2MZ4?t=4261s)**

Let’s add some shadows to our work, to bring some depth to our logo design. We’ll do so using gradients, as we explored earlier in the course. We’ll make them blend in, and manipulate the shape so it seamlessly works with the shape we’ve put together.

Ready to make some magic happen? Let’s begin.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Shadows](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181423/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_23b-1.jpg)</figure>### 4.3 Adding Highlights

**[Watch Video Lesson (2 mins) ↗](https://youtu.be/YycxaAK2MZ4?t=4654)**

We can also use these concepts to add highlights. Let’s take the same idea as the last lesson, and apply it to the top of our logo design.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Highlights](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181424/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_24b-1.jpg)</figure>Remember, you can always return to your **Gradient** panel and **Swatches** panel to make adjustments to the colors in your work. We’ll walk through that again in this lesson.

### 4.4 Adjusting the Logo’s Color

**[Watch Video Lesson (1 min) ↗](https://youtu.be/YycxaAK2MZ4?t=4743s)**

But what if you want to experiment with your logo design’s color? It’s time to go back to our swatches again. This time, you’ll really get a hands-on feel for just how convenient working with swatches can be. We can easily sample new colors and make adjustments. Ready to give it a try?

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Global Swatches](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181425/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_25b-1.jpg)</figure>This is such a great example of why those swatches from earlier in the course are important! Remember, you can open the Swatches panel by going to **Window &gt; Swatches**.

### 4.5 Changing the Color Mode (RBG and CMYK)

**[Watch Video Lesson (1 min) ↗](https://youtu.be/YycxaAK2MZ4?t=4839s)**

Your color mode will matter, depending on how you plan to use your work. If you plan to print, for example, you’ll likely want to switch over to CMYK. Let’s walk through changing the color mode together in this lesson.

**RGB** stands for “Red Green Blue” and is color intended for screens. **CMYK** stands for “Cyan Magenta Yellow Black” and is intended for print.

## 5. How to Complete Your Logo Design in Adobe Illustrator

### 5.1 Grouping Your Completed Logo

**[Watch Video Lesson (1 min) ↗](https://youtu.be/YycxaAK2MZ4?t=4892s)**

You’ll likely need to move or resize your logo at some point. It can be very convenient to group your completed work so that nothing gets accidentally bumped or changed. In this lesson, we’ll walk through this simple process together.

You can also ungroup your work by going to **Object &gt; Ungroup**.

### 5.2 Using and Positioning Your Work With Artboards

**[Watch Video Lesson (2 mins) ↗](https://youtu.be/YycxaAK2MZ4?t=4922s)**

Let’s create and adjust our artboards in this lesson. What are artboards? Consider them like a canvas in your work area. You can have more than one, and this might be advantageous in some cases. We’ll use the **Artboard Tool** to adjust, resize, and create some new artboards in this lesson, as we finalize our work.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Artboards](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181426/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_26b-1.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Two artboards at different sizes.</figcaption></figure>### 5.3 Exporting Your Logo

**[Watch Video Lesson (4 min) ↗](https://youtu.be/YycxaAK2MZ4?t=5071s)**

Once your logo design is complete, it’s time to **Export**! Let’s walk through the process together so you can save and prepare your work for use. We’re almost at the finish line!

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Illustrator Export](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/01/12181427/how_to_design_a_logo_in_illustrator_27b-1.jpg)</figure>Because we’ve made more than one artboard, we have the option of selecting which artboard we’d like to export—you can name them, too, for your convenience!
