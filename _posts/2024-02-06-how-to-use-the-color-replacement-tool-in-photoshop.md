## 1. Where Is the Color Replacement Brush in Photoshop?

### Step 1

Let’s start learning how to replace color in Photoshop. You can replace colors in Photoshop with the **Color Replacement Brush**, found in the **Tools** panel.

### Step 2

If you don’t see the Photoshop **Color Replacement Tool** in this panel, press the **Edit Toolbar** icon and select it here.

Color Replacement Tool Photoshop Settings

### Step 1

Before using the Color Replacement Tool in Photoshop, you need to open the image and select the color you want.

### Step 2

Now you can set the **Size**, **Hardness**, and **Spacing** of your brush.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![setting up color replacement brush](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/39825/image-upload/setting_up_color_replacement_brush.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 3

After that, you can select one of the **Blending Modes**: **Color**, **Hue**, **Saturation**, or **Luminosity**. The **Color** mode is a default setting that will change the hue and the saturation. Hue settings will only affect the hue, Saturation will only affect the saturation, and the Luminosity will match the brightness of the original color to the brightness of the new color, while hue and saturation will be unaffected.

If you want to use Photoshop to replace one color with another, you should select **Color,** and in most cases, this will be your best choice.

Take a look at some examples of using Photoshop to replace a color with brush blend modes below:

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![color replacement tool blending modes](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/39825/image-upload/color_replacement_tool_blending_modes.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 4

The next setting is **Sampling**, and you can choose from three options: **Continuous**, **Once**, and **Background Swatch**.

**Continuous Sampling** will always look for the color you’re painting over, **Once Sampling** will follow the color from the initial point of your brush, and **Background Swatch** will only paint over the areas that match your **Background Color**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![replacement tool painting modes](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/39825/image-upload/replacement_tool_painting_modes.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 5

The **Limits** setting controls the “spread” of the colors. This option sets the boundary up to which it can affect the color.

- **Contiguous** will affect only the sampled area of pixels where the crosshair of your brush is. It will not change the color of the adjacent areas that match the same color.
- **Discontiguous** will change the color of the adjoining areas with a matching sampled color up to the spread of the crosshair boundaries.
- **Find Edges** will find the edges in your image and stop as it approaches the edge. The color change will affect only the edges.

In most cases, **Contiguous** will be the best option to use.

The **Tolerance** setting controls how similar the color will be to your sampled color.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![tolerance settings](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/1381/posts/39825/image-upload/tolerance_settings.jpg)</figure></div>## 3. How to Use the Color Replacement Brush

So, to use Photoshop to replace one color with another, let’s set the following settings:

- **Brush Size: 160**
- **Mode: Color**
- **Sampling: Continuous**
- **Limits: Contiguous**
- **Tolerance: 75%**

After that, just paint over the areas where you want to change the color of your image.
