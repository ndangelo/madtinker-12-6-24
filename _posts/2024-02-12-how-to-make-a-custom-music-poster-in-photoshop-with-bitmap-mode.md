## 1. How to Set Up a New Photoshop File

### **Step 1**

In **Photoshop**, go to **File &gt; New**. Name the document *Music Poster.* Set the **Width** to **1270 px** and **Height** to **1600 px**. Set the **Resolution** to **72 Pixels/Inch**. Click **OK**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Create a new Photoshop file](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-1)</figure></div>### **Step 2**

Press **Command-R** to bring up the rules around the document. Head over to **View &gt; New Guide.** In the **New Guide** window option, select **Horizontal** and set the guide to **50 px.** Click **OK.**

Do the same for the other sides of the document by subtracting **50 px** from the final size.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Add margin guides to the page](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-2.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 3**

To create an interesting layout, we will create a slightly off-center layout. The goal is to create something unexpected in this bitmap Photoshop poster instead of the regular centered layout.

The way I determined this layout was by applying the rule of thirds. This technique is applied by dividing the poster size into three rows and columns. The guides we created are not exactly divided into thirds—they are slightly off to accommodate the text and images. By doing this, we are already breaking away from the normal poster. We will create four spaces to mix text and images.

Head over to **View &gt; New Guide.** Select Vertical in the New Guide window option and set the guide to **800 px.** Click **OK.** Let’s do the same for the **horizontal** guide, setting it to **980 px.** Click **OK.**

To activate and deactivate the guides, press **Command-;.** I will hide my guides for now until we need them.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Additionally create another set guides inside the page This time off centre](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-3.jpg)</figure></div>## 2. How to Use Photoshop Bitmap Mode

A Photoshop bitmap is an alternative to vector in which an image is converted into black and white pixels. This technique is commonly used for screen printing or newspapers.

We can choose between a handful of different patterns and set the amount of detail we want to maintain. To create screened images, we need to open them separately.

### **Step 1**

Open the isolated headphones image.

In the **Layers** panel, unlock the main layer by clicking twice on the lock. Click **OK** in the **New Layer** option window.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Open the isolated headphones image and unlock it](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-4.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 2**

Head over to **Image &gt; Mode &gt; Grayscale,** followed by **Image &gt; Mode &gt; Bitmap**. Click **OK** in the **Flatten Layers** option window.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Conver the image into Grayscale followed by Bitmap](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-5.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 3**

Set the Output to 72 Pixels/Inch in the Bitmap option window. Under Method, Use **Halftone Screen.** Click **OK.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Set the output to 72 Pixelsinch and use the Halftone Screen](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-6.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 4**

In the **Halftone Screen** option window, set the **Frequency** to **2 Lines/Inch,** the **Angle** to **45 degrees,** and the **Shape** to **Line.** Click **OK.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Set the Frequency Shape and Angle](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-7.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 5**

To use the image, we need to turn it back to Grayscale. Head over to **Image &gt; Mode &gt; Grayscale**. In the **Grayscale** option window, set the **Size Ratio** to **1**. Click **OK.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Conver the image into Grayscale](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-8.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 6**

Let’s duplicate this image onto the *Music Poster.* In the **Layers** panel, **Right-click &gt; Duplicate Layer.** In the **Duplicate Layer** option window, name the layer *headphones.* Under **Destination**, select the *Music Poster* Photoshop file. Click **OK.**

Close the isolated headphones image. We won’t need to save it because we’ve already duplicated it into the main Photoshop file.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Duplicate the image onto the original music poster file](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-9.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 7**

Open the DJ image. In the **Layers** panel, **double-click** on the layer to unlock it. In the **New Layer** option window, click **OK.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Open the DJ image and unlock the layer](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-10.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 8**

We need to delete the background for this specific image to have an isolated DJ. In the **Layers** panel, click on the **Add a layer mask** button.

In the **Tools** panel, select the **Magic Wand Tool (W).** Click to select the background, and hold down **Shift** on your keyboard to add to the selection. It doesn’t need to be perfect, but we must delete as much background as possible.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Using the Magic Wand Tool select the background on the image](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-11.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 9**

Once you’ve selected the background, press **Command-I** on your keyboard to invert the mask. Ensure you do this on the **Layer Mask** we added to the main layer.

To deselect, press **Command-D.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Invert the background to eliminate it](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-12.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 10**

To continue, we need to apply the **Layer Mask** to the main layer. Select the **Layer Mask** (**right-click &gt; Apply Layer Mask**).

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Apply the layer mask to the DJ layer](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-13.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 11**

Head over to **Image &gt; Mode &gt; Grayscale,** followed by **Image &gt; Mode &gt; Bitmap**. Click **OK i**n the **Flatten Layers** option window**.**

Set the Output to 240 Pixels/Inch in the Bitmap option window**.** Under **Method, Use: Halftone Screen.** Click **OK.**

In the **Halftone Screen** option window, set the **Frequency** to **25 Lines/Inch,** the **Angle** to **45 degrees**, and the **Shape** to **Round.** Click **OK.**

Turn the file back to Grayscale. Head over to **Image &gt; Mode &gt; Grayscale.** In the **Grayscale** option window, set the **Size Ratio** to **1**. Click **OK.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Convert the image into Grayscale and bitmap](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-14.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 12**

Let’s duplicate this image onto the *Music Poster.* **Right-click** on the layer and choose **Duplicate Layer.** In the **Duplicate Layer** option window, name the layer *DJ.* Under **Destination**, select the *Music Poster* Photoshop file. Click **OK.**

Close the image. We won’t need to save it because we’ve already duplicated it into the main Photoshop file.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Duplicate the layer onto the Music Poster file](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-15.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 13**

Let’s go back to the main *Music Poster* file to resize the screened images.

To show the guides, press **Command-;.**

Using the guides we created at the beginning of this tutorial, we will resize the images to fit the spaces. Let’s start with the *DJ* layer. Press **Command-T** to transform. Head over to the **Options** bar and activate the **Maintain Aspect Ratio** button. Set the **Width** or **Heigh**t to **85%**, and press **Enter.** Place the image on the right side of the poster.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Resize and move the image to the right side of the poster](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-16.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 14**

We can add a **Layer Mask** to delete parts of the layer we aren’t using. Click on the **Add Layer Mask** button. Using the **Rectangular Marquee Tool (M),** select the left side of the poster. Press **Command-I** to invert the mask. Press **Command-D** to deselect.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Using Layer masks delete the part of the image we wont be using](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-17.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 15**

Let’s work on the *headphones* layer. Press **Command-T** to transform. Head over to the **Options** bar, and activate the **Maintain Aspect Ratio** button. Set the **Width** or **Height** to **22%**, and press **Enter.** Place the image in the lower left quadrant of the poster.

As in the step above, we can add a **Layer Mask** and delete the parts we won’t be using. Click **on the Add Layer Mask** button. Select the image’s top side using the Rectangular Marquee Tool (M). Press **Command-I** to invert the mask. Press **Command-D** to deselect.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Resize and move the headphones image Using layer masks delete the top part we wont be using](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-18.jpg)</figure></div>## 3. How to Create a Digital Screen Effect

### **Step 1**

In the **Layers** panel, create a new layer by pressing **Shift-Command-N. Name** the layer *Screen***.** Click **OK.**

Select the **Brush Tool (B)** from the **Tools** panel. **Right-click** to change the settings. Set the **Size** to **400 px** and the **Hardness** to **0%.** Using the color codes below, brush over the page to cover it.

- Yellow: `#ffb20e`
- Pink: `#ff12de`
- Blue: `#0078ff`

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Create a new layer and using the color codes brush over the page](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-19.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 2**

Head over to **Filter &gt; Distort &gt; Wave.** In the **Wave** option window, use the following settings:

- **Number of Generators: 1**
- **Type: Sine**
- **Wavelength: Min. 1** and **Max. 2**
- **Amplitude: Min. 295** and **Max. 375**
- **Scale: Horiz. 100%** and **Vert. 100%.**
- **Undefined Areas: Repeat Edge Pixels**

Click **OK.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Apply the Wave filter to the new layer](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-20.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 3**

We need to run this image through a second process to create the cardioid-style pattern. While on the same layer, head over to **Filter &gt; Distort &gt; Polar Coordinates.**

In the **Polar Coordinates** option window, select the **Polar Rectangular** option. Click **OK.**

If the colors are not as you hoped, we can tweak them later. Please note that the result will vary, and that’s the fun part!

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Apply the Polar coordinates filter after the Wave filter](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-21.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 4**

Select the top left quadrant of the poster using the Rectangular Marquee Tool (M)—press **Shift** to add to the selection and select a small section of the bottom right side. We will be using this later when we add information. Once you have these two selections, click on the **Layer Mask** button. This will create a mask around the selection.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Create a layer mask to delete the parts we wont be using](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-22.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 5**

To change the color of the *Screen* layer, click on **Create a new fill or adjustment layer &gt; Hue/Saturation.** The **Properties** panel will automatically open. If the opposite, double-click on the **Hue/Saturation** layer thumbnail. I am adjusting the **Hue** to **-25.** Feel free to experiment!

We want to apply this adjustment layer only to the *Screen* layer. **Right-click &gt; Create Clipping Mask.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Add a HueSaturation Adjustment layer to tweak colors](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-23.jpg)</figure></div>### **Step 6**

At this point, the poster is looking slightly flat. The aim is to create tension that will lead the viewer from the main copy to the rest of the information.

Tension is important in a poster because it provides focus and contrast from the other elements. It also creates a path of where the eyes should be going. Something as small as a rectangle can make the biggest difference.

From the **Tools** panel, select the **Rectangle Tool (U).** Click on the page, and set the **Width** to **30 px** and the **Height** to **1600 px.** Click **OK.** Head to the **Options** bar, and set the **Fill** to black. Place the rectangle vertically between the *Screen* image and the D*J*.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Create a rectangle to create tension on the poster](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-24.jpg)</figure></div>## 4. How to Add Text

To be able to use a bigger font size, I split the word Introspektive onto two lines. Additionally, I used a lighter weight on Musik as it comes secondary to the main word. Since a lot is going on visually, I chose to keep the rest of the information in a single weight and size.

In the **Tools** panel, select the **Text Tool (T).** I used white text to contrast with the background. Use a typeface like Fonseca Font Family Pack from Envato Elements. Bring up the Tools panel to **Type &gt; Panels &gt; Character Panel.** Below are the details I added; each bullet point is a separate layer. Use the guides we created at the beginning of the tutorial to align the text.

- INTROS—PEKTIVEMUSIC **(US Bill in ExtraBold and Light, Size: 120 pt, Leading: 100 pt, Tracking: 200 pt)**
- 10.—23. JULI 2019FRANKFURT AM MAIN02.—17. OKT 2019BERLIN06.—19. JÄN 2020MUNCHEN **(US Bill in Bold, Size: 30 pt, Leading: 40 pt, Tracking: 200 pt)**
- MWM.DE **(US Bill in Bold, Size: 30 pt, Leading: 40 pt, Tracking: 200 pt)**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Add information to the poster](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-25.jpg)</figure></div>## 5. How to Save the File for the Web

Head over to **File &gt; Save** and save the file as you would normally.

To save a JPEG file for the web, head over to **File &gt; Save for Web** or **Shift-Option-Command-S**. Select the file type you want to save the document in—I am choosing **JPEG**—and set **100** for **Quality**. Under **Image size**, you can change the pixel size of the image if you have any size constraints.

You can see a preview of the file size on the bottom left-hand side. This is useful when there are size constraints on a website and you need to lower the image’s quality or size.

Click on **Save…** to choose the location in the new window, and click on **Save** again. And you’ll have your bitmap Photoshop poster.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![Save the file for Web](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/2056/posts/31520/image/007-3-Music-Poster-26.jpg)</figure></div>## You’ve Finished This Bitmap Photoshop Tutorial for Custom Music Poster Designs!

In this tutorial, we reviewed how to design a music poster in Photoshop and learned how to edit a bitmap in Photoshop. We covered some cool effects that will provide different results for everyone. Today, we’ve learned to:

- Convert images into Bitmap in Photoshop to create a screen-printed effect.
- Use Layer Masks and Clipping Masks to change colors on a single layer.
- Use the Wave and Polar Coordinate filters to create a digital screen effect.
- Apply some design theory, such as grids, typography, hierarchy, and visual tension.
