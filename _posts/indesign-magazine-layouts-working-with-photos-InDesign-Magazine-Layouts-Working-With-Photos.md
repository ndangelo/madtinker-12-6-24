### **Tip Number 1: Don’t Be Afraid to Go Black-and-White**

---

Sure, full-color photos can look amazing, but if you’re looking for something all-together cooler in your layouts, don’t be afraid to use black-and-white photography.

Greyscale images make a superb backdrop for punchy typography, which looks great on magazines, posters and flyers.

<div class="code-block code-block-3"></div>[![working with photos layouts indesign photography graphic design black-and-white photo]()](http://www.indesignskills.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1.jpg)

To recreate the layout design shown here, just follow the steps below.

### **Step 1**

First up, create a **New Document** in **InDesign** (go to **File &gt; New &gt; Document**) and create your page or spread at the size you would like. Use the **Rectangle Frame Tool (F)** to draw a frame and expand across the whole page.

### **Step 2**

Download a ready prepared black-and-white image like [this one of a desert road](https://www.ingimage.com/?/imagedetails_EN&imgid=80808026&urefid=IMSUSER:65D895EC-9DC7-2803-B16BC0CD0CADE471), or open up a color photo in **Adobe Photoshop** and use the **Black &amp; White Adjustment** available in the **Layers** panel to desaturate the image of color. Resave the image, and then return to **InDesign**.

### **Step 3**

With the rectangle frame selected, go to **File &gt; Place** to drop your black-and-white image inside the frame; then choose **Fill Frame Proportionally** from the top control panel to fit the image nicely in the frame.

[![working with photos layouts indesign photography graphic design black-and-white photo](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2018/03/08153343/318.jpg)](http://www.indesignskills.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3.jpg)

<div class="code-block code-block-2"><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4786340380234672" data-ad-slot="1520815177" data-adsbygoogle-status="done"><ins id="aswift_1_expand"><ins id="aswift_1_anchor"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1" frameborder="0" height="250" id="aswift_1" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" name="aswift_1" scrolling="no" width="300"></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>### **Step 4**

Expand or open the **Layers** panel **(Window &gt; Layers)** and lock *Layer 1*. Create a new layer on top of this by choosing **New Layer…** from the panel’s drop-down menu.

You can experiment with your typography on this layer, without worrying about shifting the position of the photo frame below.

[![working with photos layouts indesign photography graphic design black-and-white photo layers panel](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2018/03/08153345/4.png)](http://www.indesignskills.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4.png)

To mimic the style of the text pictured here, download and install the free font [**Sanchez**](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/sanchez). Using the **Type Tool (T)** set each individual letter of the heading in its own separate text frame. Set the **Font** to **Sanchez Regular**, and vary the size of the letters to give a sense of movement.

[![working with photos layouts indesign photography graphic design black-and-white photo](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2018/03/08153347/4.11.jpg)](http://www.indesignskills.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4.1.jpg)

For this particular photo it makes sense that the letters would decrease in size towards the horizon to give the impression of distance, but you might find that a different arrangement will work better for your particular photo choice.

<div class="code-block code-block-4"></div>### **Step 5**

Acidic, neon colors work so well against black-and-white photos. Here, I’ve used a zesty, pure yellow. Create a new CMYK swatch from the **Swatches** panel **(Window &gt; Color &gt; Swatches)**and set the values to **C=0 M=0 Y=83 K=0**.

To recreate the hazy effect used across the heading, drag your mouse across the page to select a number of text frames and **Right-Click** (Windows) or **Ctrl-Click** (Mac OS) **&gt; Group**. Then with the group selected, go to **Object &gt; Effects &gt; Transparency**. Under the **Transparency** settings set the **Mode** to **Overlay**.

[![working with photos layouts indesign photography graphic design black-and-white photo overlay transparency](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2018/03/08153349/5.png)](http://www.indesignskills.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5.png)

Move down the left-hand menu in the **Effects** window and select **Gradient Feather**. Adjust the angle and harshness (by adjusting the slider stops) of the gradient.

Then click **OK** once you’re happy with the result.

### **Tip Number 2: Take a Closer Look…**

---

Playing with the scale of your photos can make a huge difference to the impact of your layout.

If you have a very high-quality image, like [this one](https://www.ingimage.com/?/imagedetails_EN&imgid=65418439&urefid=IMSUSER:65D895EC-9DC7-2803-B16BC0CD0CADE471)…

[![working with photos layouts indesign photography graphic design horse](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2018/03/08153355/Horse-1.jpg)](http://www.indesignskills.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Horse-1.jpg)

…try zooming into the details to give the photo a more interesting focus. Getting really close-up to the details of a photo is a fantastic way of getting the reader to notice the quality and beauty of a particular photograph.

[![working with photos layouts indesign photography graphic design horse zoomed in close-up]()](http://www.indesignskills.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Horse-2.jpg)

To edit the scale of images in InDesign, first **File &gt; Place** your image into an image frame; then double-click inside the frame to directly select the image. Hold down **Shift** while you drag the corners outwards to maintain the proportions of the photo.

### **Tip Number 3: Make Photos and Type Interact** 

---

It’s all very well placing text beside or on top of a photo, but sometimes it can look, well, a little dull.

Look out for photos which allow you to place text on top in an interesting, interactive way.

Take this example layout. With [the woman](https://www.ingimage.com/?/imagedetails_EN&imgid=38459532&urefid=IMSUSER:65D895EC-9DC7-2803-B16BC0CD0CADE471) positioned centrally on the layout, we have plenty of room to get creative with text. To the left side, the text is set in **Adobe Caslon Pro Regular**and has a conventional horizontal format.

[![working with photos images indesign layouts photography animated typography]()](http://www.indesignskills.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Snow-2.jpg)

To the right, to exaggerate the snow being blown from her hands, letters in **Adobe Caslon Pro Italic** are set in individual text frames and rotated slightly to create a jaunty, animated appearance.

[![working with photos images indesign layouts photography animated typography]()](http://www.indesignskills.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Snow-1.jpg)

A gradient **(Window &gt; Effects &gt; Gradient Feather)** applied to the letters as a group adds to the overall effect.
