**InDesign is primarily designed for creating print documents, which means it works by default in CMYK color when you set the Intent of your document to Print. You should know a little about how InDesign translates Swatches to final printed colors on your document before sending anything to print to avoid any problems at the press.**

InDesign offers lots of different modes of color that you can use in the program, but the ones you need to know about are **CMYK,** P**antone** and **RGB**.

If you’re creating a document for print, you should always set colors as <span style="color: #993366;">**CMYK swatches,**</span> unless instructed directly otherwise by your printer (e.g. if they would recommend printing a certain color as a **Pantone**). InDesign will automatically work with **CMYK** swatches when you set the **intent** to Print in the **new Document** window.

To view the color **swatches** when you create a new document, go to **Window &gt; Color &gt; swatches**. A default set of **CMYK swatches** will already be available to you in the **swatches Panel**. To add a new swatch click on the three bars at the top-right of the panel to open the drop-down menu. Select **new Color swatch…** and set the **Color type** to **Process** (**not spot**, unless you want to create a **spot Color layer** in your final PDF) and **Mode** to **CMYK**. Click **add,** and **Ok.**

To apply a color to text, a shape or a frame in your document, select the element and apply the swatch from either the **swatches Panel** or the control panel running along the top of the screen. You can apply a **Fill** and/or a **stroke** color by switching between the two square symbols in the top control panel or at the bottom of the **tools Panel**.

To apply a **<span style="color: #993366;">tint</span>** of a color to an element, select the element and apply the swatch as above. In the **swatches Panel**, or from the top control panel, click the arrow adjacent to **tint: 100%** to adjust the saturation of color.

You can also apply a **<span style="color: #993366;">gradient</span>** effect to a colored element by going to **Window &gt; Color &gt; gradient**.
