1–2 weeks. The project is expected to be completed within two weeks.

## **Objectives**

We are looking for a redesign for the Swedish tourism website. The site needs a refresh, and we require it to be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and provide all the necessary information to help visitors plan a trip. Our culture should be reflected across the site, especially famous landmarks and common local native words.

**Success Metrics to Consider**

- Engagement rate (time spent on site, pages viewed per session)
- Conversion rate (number of bookings or inquiries)
- Customer satisfaction (rating and feedback)

## Platform

Please design website screens for desktop (1440px wide and mobile view 365px wide).

## Specifications/ Limitations

The site must load quickly; hence, any large interactions must be kept to a minimum.

## References

References that our company would like the website to follow in terms of structure and layout. It will be your job to replicate something close to these websites but add your creative flair to it.

⁃ **Things to Do:** This section should provide information on the top tourist attractions, outdoor activities, and cultural experiences in the area.  
⁃ **Places to Stay:** This section should provide information on the best hotels, resorts, and vacation rentals in the area.  
⁃ **Local Food:** This section should highlight the local cuisine and provide recommendations for restaurants and food experiences.  
⁃ **Travel Tips:** This section should provide helpful information for travelers, such as visa requirements, currency exchange, and transportation options.  
⁃ **Booking:** This section should allow users to book tours and activities directly from the website.  
⁃ **Blog:** This section should provide fresh and relevant content to attract visitors and improve SEO.

### Testing and Results section

Show your wireframes to 5 people and ask them using your designs what they think about them, what they would improve, and an overall rating.

Take their feedback, iterate the designs, and have a final round of testing with 5 users. See that you improve your overall rating. If not go back to the drawing board and change your designs and retest.
