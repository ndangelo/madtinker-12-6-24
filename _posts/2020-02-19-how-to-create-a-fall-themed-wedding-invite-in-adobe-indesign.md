Fall is such a romantic and atmospheric time of year to get married. These autumnal invitations pay tribute to the earthy colors and falling leaves that lend the season its cosy mood.

The invites are quick and simple to create, and we’ll set up the cards in InDesign. Perfect for beginners to the software, this is a great all-round introduction to print design. You can also add optional metallic foiling to the cards, to give an extra touch of luxury to the design.

If you’re short on time and looking for a quick fix, you can find tons of [stylish invitation templates](https://elements.envato.com/graphic-templates/wedding) to suit every wedding theme and style over on [Envato Elements](https://elements.envato.com/graphic-templates/wedding) and [GraphicRiver](https://graphicriver.net/category/print-templates/cards-invites/weddings).

## What You’ll Need to Create Your Invite

We’ll be using **Adobe InDesign** to set up the main layout, and dipping into **Illustrator** for editing the leaf graphics, so make sure you have access to both of these programs. You’ll also need to download a few fonts and graphics to give you a foundation for creating your invitation:

- [Textured paper background](https://pixabay.com/en/vintage-texture-vintage-paper-retro-2714966/)
- [Jacques Francois](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/jacques-francois) font
- [England Hand](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/England-Hand-DB) font
- [IM FELL FLOWERS 2](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/im-fell-flowers-2) font

Save the images to a folder you can easily find, and install the fonts onto your computer.

One thing that many people forget about when they are trying to design their own wedding invitations is the envelope! Envelopes come in a variety of standard sizes, whereas invites can vary widely in size, so it’s always a good idea to pin down your envelope size first, before you size your invitation.

We’ll be setting up the invitation card at a standard size of 109 mm by 154 mm. To accommodate this, you’ll need to buy envelopes which are 4.75 in by 6.5 in when folded and closed. These are sometimes known as ‘6 Baronial’ envelopes.

## 1. How to Set Up the Invite in InDesign

### Step 1

Open up **InDesign** and go to **File > New > Document.**

Keep the **Intent** set to **Print** and **Number of Pages** to **1**. Uncheck the **Facing Pages** box.

Set the **Width** of the page to **109 mm** and **Height** to **154 mm.** Add **Margins** of **7 mm** and a **Bleed** of **5 mm**. Then head up and click **OK**.

### Step 2

Expand the **Layers** panel (**Window > Layers**) and double-click on ***Layer 1*** to open the **Layer Options** window. Rename the layer ***Background*** and click **OK**.

Choose **New Layer** from the panel’s drop-down menu (at top-right). Name this second layer ***Paper***, and click **OK**.

Create a further two new layers, firstly ***Typography*** and finally ***Leaves*** at the top of the sequence.
