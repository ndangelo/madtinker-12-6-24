## Creating a Social Media hashtag Campaign – A step-by-step guide

## 1. What are social media hashtag campaigns

A hashtags campaign is a social media campaign using a specific hashtag to increase brand awareness, build a community and gain user-generated content. The chosen hashtag is a brand-specific one.

Simply put, [hashtags](https://www.socialinsider.io/blog/instagram-hashtags-dont-affect-post-views/) are used as keywords that can help you propel your campaign’s posts into the vast world of the internet so that more and more users can see them.

You use a hashtag to make your social media campaign more visible to show that your brand resonates with your audience.

If your target audience comprises people from the age group 24-30 years old, who travel the world, then it’s clear that your next campaign should feature a hashtag that they will surely use.

You will get user-generated content through your hashtag campaign because you promote the launch of a product or service that satisfies your audience’s needs.

When launching your new giveaway, service or product, you use a hashtag campaign to increase brand awareness and create buzz around that topic.

## 2. Why hashtags are important for your social media campaign

A social media hashtag campaign can help you grow your brand in many ways. These type of campaigns are really a big deal and here are a few reasons why you should use hashtag campaigns for your social media strategy:

## Grow brand awareness

By choosing the right hashtag for your [social media campaign](https://influencermarketinghub.com/hashtag-campaigns/), you definitely get to attract more users.

The curiosity building up around the hashtag will help you spread the word about the new launch, products and services.

The catchier the hashtag you choose for your campaign, the bigger the audience you get around your brand.

Make sure the hashtag you choose for your campaign is in line with your brand’s values and long-term social media campaign’s goal.

This is how you know you promote the right image for your brand.

- Increase reach &amp; impressions

Your reach and impressions will increase as your new social media campaign’s hashtag grows more popular.

The virality of your hashtag will bring you high values for reach and impressions while also boosting your engagement.

- Get user-generated content

When you launch a hashtag campaign that perfectly suits your audience’s preferences and needs, you’ll surely get user-generated content.

Those who use your products and are satisfied with what you offer will clearly use your new campaign hashtag and become part of the thread.

When they use your hashtag, their community will find out about you and be curious to get to your TikTok or Instagram to learn more.

- Increase community engagement

As more users find out about your hashtag campaign through all the user-generated content that creates buzz around you, your community engagement will flourish.

And high values for your social media metrics can make your campaign viral and your brand more popular.

## 5. How to choose a hashtag for your campaign

When choosing the suitable hashtag for your new social media campaign, it’s important to consider a few guidelines to make sure you avoid creating confusing word combos and use them as a hashtag.

Here is a list of instructions you should keep an eye on when deciding on the hashtag campaign:

- your hashtag should be original and no other brand should have used it to make it appear as your trademark;
- your hashtag should rely on trending topics, but not only that. It should be about your brand, but it should not solely rely on promoting it. It should also be about the buyer persona you’re targeting through your campaign. Put your creativity at work. For instance, there’s L’Oreal’s hashtag campaign #WorthIt that says more about the customer, than about the beauty brand itself;
- your hashtag needs to be memorable, precise and easy to pronounce. Avoid combining more than 3-4 words. If your hashtag is too long, users will not remember it;
- make sure you use your competitors’ campaigns only as a source of inspiration and don’t replicate their hashtag campaigns. Otherwise, people will tell and you may risk losing followers;
- your hashtag needs to be easy to understand, so it’s best if you write it in Title case;
- the hashtag used for your social media campaign should not be over-promotional and should not include offensive words.

A catchy hashtag can turn a hashtag campaign into a viral trend. When crafting a hashtag, ensure it reflects your brand’s values and new product while also being playful to attract attention. These tips on creating a hashtag campaign for social media will be valuable for future planning. Ensure the campaign is creative and purposeful to engage your community effectively. To enhance your social media marketing strategy, consider a comprehensive guide that provides insights for creating a plan from scratch, offering valuable advice for beginners and those reevaluating priorities in 2024.

## What is social media marketing?

Social media marketing involves leveraging platforms such as Instagram, X (formerly known as Twitter), and Facebook to promote your brand and sell products or services. Activities like launching new items, engaging with customers through comments, and creating compelling content that reflects your brand’s values constitute social media marketing. Successful execution of this marketing approach requires applying social media management skills and tools.

Developing a plan for social media marketing is essential, akin to preparing other aspects of your overall marketing strategy. The process involves creating a strategy in seven steps, as the accompanying video details.

## Set goals that make sense for your business

Social media strategy planning starts with your goals. Whether you want to expand your team, build a larger following or a more active community, defining your social goals is the first step to reaching them.

Either way, your goals will define your social media marketing strategy and how much time and energy you must dedicate to your campaigns.

### Example social media goals for 2024 and beyond

What matters is that you set realistic **social media goals**. We recommend tackling smaller objectives that allow you to scale your social efforts in a way that’s both reasonable and affordable.

Below are some examples of social media marketing goals businesses of all shapes and sizes can pursue.

#### Goal example 1: Increase brand awareness

**Brand awareness** means getting your name out there. Some 68% of consumers say they follow a brand on social media to stay informed about new products or services.

Avoid solely publishing promotional messages and strike a good balance with authentic content that emphasizes your brand’s voice and story.

For example, in this TikTok video, Sani, a family-owned apparel company features a day in the life of the brand’s founders while visiting India for business:

<figure class="wp-block-image">[![The thumbnail image for a TikTok video link. Click to go to the Sani Sisters TikTok.](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/11/06184929/Open-TikTok-For-You-feed-e1695221975853-11.jpg)](https://www.tiktok.com/@sanisisters/video/7277241863877217579?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc)</figure>#### Goal example 2: Generate leads and sales

Whether online, in-store or through your social profiles, followers don’t accidentally make purchases. For example, are you alerting customers about new products and promos? Are you integrating your product catalog into your social profiles? Are you running exclusive deals for followers? Social media gives you an avenue to generate revenue.

<figure class="wp-block-image">[![Cami Cake's Cupcakes Instagram post featuring an assortment of cupcakes. The caption reads, "Happy $2 Tuesday! 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. every Tuesday. #camicakes #cupcakes."](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/11/06184931/Screenshot-2023-09-18-at-12.45.10-PM-11.png)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CwP_ygduOKG/)</figure>#### Goal example 3: Grow your brand’s audience

Bringing new followers into the fold means finding ways to introduce your brand to folks who haven’t heard of you before. Growing your audience also means discovering conversations around your business and industry that matter the most. Digging through your social channels is nearly impossible without **monitoring or listening** for specific keywords, phrases or hashtags. Having a pulse on these conversations helps you expand your core audience (and reach adjacent audiences) much faster.

## Research your target audience and select your networks

Making assumptions is bad news for marketers. Both leaders and practitioners can disprove assumptions from social data’s valuable insights. With the right tool, marketers can quickly research their audience. No formal market research or data science chops necessary.

What you need to know about your audience to influence your social media marketing strategy is already available. You have to know where to look.

### Remember: different platforms attract different audiences

Here are some key numbers for your 2024 social media marketing strategy that speak directly to which networks your brand should approach and what types of content to publish:

- Instagram has [3 billion active users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183585/instagram-number-of-global-users/) worldwide in 2023 and is projected to increase to 1.4 billion in 2024.
- Women make up more than [60% of Pinterest’s global audience](https://business.pinterest.com/en/audience/). Gen Z and Millennials use the platform the most.
- X has[ over half a billion](https://business.twitter.com/) monthly monetizable active users. And people spend an average of 31 minutes on the platform.
- [LinkedIn](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/linkedin-for-business/) is the hub for in-depth, industry-specific content that might be more niche than what you see on Facebook or X.
- LinkedIn is the top platform for B2B lead generation, rated by marketers. Some [4 out of 5 LinkedIn members](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/cx/17/06/advertise-on-linkedin?trk=sem_lms_gaw&src=go-pa&veh=LMS_EMEA_Deprioritized_ROE_Search_Google-Brand_DR-PRS_Broad_HeadTerms-Alpha_All_English_Core_431738531478__linkedin%20marketing_c__kwd-7650951355_9216596360&mcid=6612464045041733646&cname=LMS_EMEA_Deprioritized_ROE_Search_Google-Brand_DR-PRS_Broad_HeadTerms-Alpha_All_English_Core&camid=9216596360&asid=94475516878&targetid=kwd-7650951355&crid=431738531478&placement=&dev=c&ends=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA88X_BRDUARIsACVMYD-TiYbftC96ncGZB8HPtrJRKITUsiptDBDfELTSpzW1pYBB4fcBX8kaAuumEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) drive business decisions.
- Some [78% of TikTok users](https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/insights) have purchased a product after watching TikTok creator content about the product.
- And some [73% of users](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-sg/tiktok-whats-next-report-2022-sg) feel a deeper connection to brands they interact with on TikTok vs other platforms.
- [YouTube](https://blog.youtube/press/) is one of the most popular search engines in the world with billions of monthly users across 80 languages and 100+ countries.

Social media demographics and statistics provide valuable insights into your target audience’s online presence. However, it’s crucial to grasp the nuances of each social network to strategically position your business.

While larger brands may maintain a presence across multiple platforms due to extensive resources, mid-size or small businesses need to be more selective.

When Meta released Threads on July 5, 2023, the social network received over 100 million registrations less than a week after its launch, making it the most rapidly downloaded app ever. The launch of Threads sparked conversations about its role in the fediverse, or decentralized social media.

While there are over 15 social media platforms available for your brand, it’s advisable not to stretch yourself too thin. Instead of attempting to dominate every platform, prioritize those that align with your industry and target audience.

Conduct thorough research on your current social media audience and concentrate on networks where your primary audience is already engaged. Further analysis is necessary to identify the characteristics of your real-world social customers accurately.

## Create (and curate) engaging social content

Your social media marketing strategy hinges on your content. At this point, you should have a pretty good idea of what to publish based on your goals, audience and brand identity. You probably feel confident in which networks to cover, too.

But what about your content strategy? Below are some tips, ideas and inspiration that can help.

### Defining your content strategy

Coming up with a [content strategy](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-content-strategy/) might seem like a lot of legwork, but it all really boils down to your goals.

- Looking to educate your audience in the B2B space? Publish blogs, news and opinions relevant to your industry.
- Trying to push e-commerce products? Post action shots of your products and photos of others showing off your swag.
- Focused on customer service? Tips, shout-outs and company updates are fair game.

Regardless of what you might post, [coming up with a hashtag](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/create-a-hashtag/) to couple with your content is a brilliant branding move.

Swip, melt, go get it!"](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/11/06185006/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-12.16.53-AM-11.png)](https://twitter.com/fentybeauty/status/1690048649894764544)</figure>Hashtags can get your attention and encourage people to share their photos interacting with your brand.

One of the best ways to stand out on social media is to define your distinct brand voice. Chances are you’ve seen a post from a particular brand that feels like, well, theirs.

The quippy, casual tone that makes Discord’s X presence beloved by casual users and moderators alike is a great example.

<figure class="wp-block-image">[![A Discord Post that reads, "Shoutout to all the lurkers in my server you know who you are."](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/11/06185012/Screenshot-2023-09-18-at-11.00.54-AM-11.png)](https://x.com/discord/status/1693669463034593375?s=46)</figure>Of course, not every company will benefit from the same sort of tone. The key is to present yourself as a human rather than a robot. Adopt a consistent brand voice and style that’s appropriate for your business.

### The importance of sticking to content themes

From graphics to Reels and beyond, numerous brands consistently use familiar content formats and creative elements. Adopting specific themes can enhance your consistency and focus on a coherent content strategy. For instance, you could rotate between memes, product photos, and user-generated content while adhering to a defined color scheme. If managing these diverse sources of social content becomes challenging, explore the use of social media management tools. These tools assist in organizing your media library and scheduling posts in advance.

### Content ideas for social media marketing in 2024

### Stories and time-sensitive posts

Stories aren’t going anywhere. Tapping into your followers’ FOMO (fear of missing out), Stories-style content is both interactive and can’t-miss. Popping up first in your followers’ feeds by default, this content can help your brand’s account “skip the line” and stay fresh in your audience’s minds.

<figure class="wp-block-image">[![Spiller Park's Instagram Story featuring a repost from a customer saying the coffee shop is their favorite in Atlanta.](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/11/06185014/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-12.28.53-AM-11.png)](https://www.instagram.com/stories/spillerpark/3189685893887177254/)</figure>Stories are especially valuable for taking your followers behind-the-scenes and making your social feed feel more personal. For example, consider how you can use Stories to cover an event or take your followers on a journey without them having to leave the comfort of the ‘gram.

### Short-form video

Social video is booming thanks to the rise of TikTok and Instagram Reels. Short-form productions dominate the social space across all platforms due to their high engagement rate.

### Posts that show off your brand’s uniqueness and human side

Both personal and personable content should be a cornerstone of your social media marketing strategy. Don’t be afraid to remind followers of the humans behind your posts. Remember that over a third of consumers are looking for authentic, original content from brands.

For example, Zoom has excellent original content on their Instagram and TikTok accounts, like this Reel that explores the different signs in the workplace:

<figure class="wp-block-image">[![Zoom's Reel video about different zodiac signs in the workplace.](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/11/06185017/File-5-11.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CuALwsOAAOy/?igshid=MWZjMTM2ODFkZg==)</figure>## Make your social presence as timely as possible

Timeliness is arguably more important than ever for marketers. Not only are you expected to put out fresh content regularly, but also to always be “on” for your followers. But you can’t always expect customers to operate on your clock. And timeliness is a tall order when you’re strapped for resources or are part of a small team.

### Post at the best times to engage

To optimize social media engagement, brands should not only focus on posting at the best times for their audience but also ensure that their social media or community managers are available to engage with customers after posting. While scheduling posts at optimal times is important for automation, the effectiveness is compromised without real-time interaction. Teams must be present to respond to product inquiries or concerns promptly, emphasizing the significance of both strategic posting times and post-engagement efforts.

## Is your social media marketing strategy future proof?

This guide underscores the various elements involved in maintaining a contemporary social presence. However, creating your own doesn’t need to be a cumbersome task. By establishing actionable goals and addressing each step outlined above, you’ll find yourself well ahead of the curve in terms of your social media marketing strategy.
