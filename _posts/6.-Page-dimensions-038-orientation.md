### Sometimes you will create an InDesign document, only to realize that you want to insert a page with different dimensions or orientation, like a pull-out page or a flipped spread. Here’s how to do it…

The Page Tool is a super useful little tool in InDesign. You can find it in the Tools panel running along the left of your screen (or Window &gt; Tools if not already open). The Page Tool allows you to select an individual page and redefine its dimensions. Select the Page Tool and hover over a page in your document which you’d like to alter. Click once and

The Page Tool allows you to select an individual page and redefine its dimensions. Select the Page Tool and hover over a page in your document which you’d like to alter. Click once and handle-bars will appear on the edges of the page.

You can drag the handles to preview a new page size before manually entering the dimensions of the page in the control panel running along the top of the screen. You can also define how the content currently on the page will sit on the new page. In the example here, I chose to Re-center the content.

You can also switch the **Orientation** of a page once you’ve created your document. InDesign gives you the option of rotating the view of a selected page, which gives you better control when putting together a landscape spread within an otherwise portrait orientated document.

Go to the **Pages Panel (Window &gt; Pages)** and click the three bars at the top-right of the panel to open the drop-down menu. With the relevant page selected in the **Pages Panel, select Page Attributes &gt; Rotate Spread View &gt;** and select a rotation value.

**TOP SKILLS TIP:** So you’ve created a whole InDesign document but now your boss wants it US Letter size, not A4. Nightmare right? Well, with a quick tip you can avoid a frustrating problem. If you go straight to **File &gt; Document Setup…** and edit page dimensions there and then, your changes will only take effect on the selected page. Instead, hop over to the **Pages Panel** and hold Shift to click and select all the pages in your document. Go back to **File &gt; Document Setup…**, make your edits and they will take effect across the whole document.
