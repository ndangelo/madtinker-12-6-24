<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full">![Twitter or X](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/08/03145850/image-146.png)</figure></div>Twitter is a free social networking site where users broadcast short posts known as tweets. These tweets can contain text, videos, photos or links. To access Twitter, users need an internet connection or smart phone to use the app or website, Twitter.com.

It is a microblogging service—a combination of blogging and instant messaging—where registered users can post, share, like, and reply to tweets with short messages. Nonregistered users can only read tweets.

People use Twitter to get the latest updates and promotions from brands<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">, communicate with friends, and follow business leaders, politicians, and celebrities. They also use it to stay current on news and events. Twitter was the first source to [break the news](https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2015/today-in-media-history-2009-hudson-river-crash-landing-photo-sent-with-twitter/) of US Airways Flight 549’s water landing</span> in New York City’s Hudson River.

Twitter is used to share information quickly. Because tweets can be delivered to followers in real time, they might seem like instant messages (IMs) to the novice user. But unlike IMs, which disappear when the user closes the application, tweets are also posted on the Twitter website. They are permanent, searchable, and public. There is also an option to protect tweets so only followers can read them.

## History of Twitter

In March 2006, Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone and Evan Williams created Twitter. The idea for Twitter came from wanting to use a short messaging system for a small group. It was available to the public in July 2006.

The definition of twitter is a short burst of inconsequential information and chirps from birds, which describes the purpose of social networking on Twitter — to share short and quick information.

Other Twitter notables:

**2012:** More than 100 million users post 340 million tweets daily.

**2013:** Twitter is in the top 10 of the most visited websites.

**2013:** Twitter files for IPO in September.

**2019:** Twitter has more than 330 million active users.

**2022:** Elon Musk, CEO of [SpaceX](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/SpaceX) and Tesla, reaches an agreement to [acquire Twitter for $44 billion](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/news/252516452/Elon-Musk-poised-to-disrupt-social-media-industry) to make it a private company in April. Acquisition was finalized in October.

**2023:** Twitter partners with investing platform eToro in April to let users access and trade stocks, cryptocurrencies and other assets from links to eToro. Musk appoints Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter in May.

Users choose what they want to see on Twitter by following other users and companies and searching topics. Generally, the timeline reflects the users’ preferences, but they may see retweets from people they follow and promote Tweets, which are paid advertisements.

### Searching on Twitter

In the search bar, users can type in a person, topic or keyword to search. There is also an #Explore function to search for keywords and trending topics.

Twitter determines what is trending based on an algorithm and users’ preferences, locations and interests. This algorithm also determines what is popular now and highlights emerging discussions and topics.

To help limit fake accounts, Twitter created the verified account symbol, which indicates the account is legitimate and belongs to the person or company. To get verified, Twitter confirms the identity of the individual or company. This helps maintain trust with users. The account must be associated with a popular brand or person and follow Twitter’s criteria using an official website, ID or email address to be verified.

### Following users

On [Facebook ](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Facebook)or LinkedIn, members need to approve social connections. But that is not the case with Twitter. Anyone can follow anyone. After finding a contact on Twitter, users can hit “Follow” on their profile page.

### Posting a tweet

When users post a tweet, the messages are posted on their profile and then appear in followers’ feeds. These tweets can also be searched on Twitter. Tweets include jokes, news, random thoughts and sharing articles; however, there is a restriction on length. Originally, Twitter limited tweet characters to 140. The limit is now 280 characters, which includes spaces and punctuation.

To weave tweets into a conversation thread or connect them to a general topic, members can add hashtags to a keyword in their post. The hashtag, which acts like a meta tag, is expressed as #keyword. This makes the tweet searchable under that keyword.

Twitter also offers TweetDeck to manage multiple accounts, schedule future tweets and more.

### Interacting on Twitter

Users can choose to retweet someone else’s post, which forwards it to followers’ timelines. They can also comment on or reply to posts. To show agreement, registered members can like a tweet.

In addition to posting tweets, users can send links and messages to each other through direct messaging. These direct messages are private between the parties sending the messages. There is a setting to receive direct messages from anyone, meaning users do not have to follow each other to start a conversation.

## Business uses for Twitter

Businesses use Twitter for brand awareness and public relations — part of their [social media marketing](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/social-media-marketing-SMM) strategy. Using Twitter helps businesses:

- interact with customers;
- provide timely customer service;
- monitor the competition; and
- announce new products, sales and events.

Businesses can also purchase promoted tweets — or ads — to help marketers reach more users or engage with followers. These tweets appear just like other posts but are labeled “promoted.”
