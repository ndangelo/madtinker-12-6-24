### How to Design a Classic Book Cover With a Modern Twist!

Redesigning covers for classic and beloved novels is big business in publishing. A well-tuned redesign can help a book reach new audiences across different generations and demographics.

In this tutorial, we’ll dip a toe into the world of classic covers and create a redesigned cover for *Moby Dick* that’s modern, stylish and surprisingly easy to recreate in Adobe InDesign and Adobe Illustrator.

This is a great tutorial for beginners to InDesign looking to learn more about book cover design and publishing design.

## 1. What Are Redesigned Book Covers?

Before we delve into designing our cover for *Moby Dick*, let’s take a moment to consider what a redesigned cover is and why publishers invest money in commissioning redesigns.

Some novels are long-standing classics and have remained well-loved favorites for centuries or decades. Think of Jane Austen’s *Pride &amp; Prejudice*, Emily Brontë’s *Wuthering Heights*, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s *The Great Gatsby*, or Harper Lee’s *To Kill a Mockingbird*. These novels have earned a firm place in the annals of literature, but sometimes younger generations either won’t have encountered these classic stories, or have the perception that they are stuffy, outdated or difficult to read.

Publishers introduce redesigned covers for classic novels periodically to inject them with fresh marketing potential and entice a new demographic of readers.

In many ways, redesigning covers for classic books is one of the most interesting, but also most difficult, processes a cover designer will encounter in their career. Their covers must do justice to the original spirit and themes of the book, while giving it a design that’s got a distinctly modern appeal.

In this tutorial we’ll look at giving Herman Melville’s *Moby Dick or “The Whale”* a modern makeover. I’ve tried to recreate the mood and theme of the book, with a silhouette of the white sperm whale from the story.

![finished cover](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104507/Full-cover-3.jpg)

You’ll learn how to set up a paperback version of the cover in **Adobe InDesign** and create a collage effect with the help of **Adobe Illustrator**. We’ll bring in a bit of vintage-style typography too, to give the cover an appropriately 19th Century nod.

This design style can be adapted to all sorts of covers—just switch up the silhouette and inside image, as in this cover design for *War & Peace*.

![war and peace redesign](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104509/War-and-peace-mock-up-1.png)

Ready to get redesigning? Great! Let’s go…

## 2. Set Up the Cover Template in Adobe InDesign

### Step 1

Open up **Adobe InDesign.**

Go to **File > New > Document**, and set the Intent of the document to **Print**. Increase the **Number of Pages** to **2** and deselect **Facing Pages**. From the **Page Size** menu, choose **Custom**.

![custom size](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104510/1.1-1.png)

Name the custom size **Paperback Book**, and set the **Width** to **132 mm** and **Height** to **197 mm**. Click **Add** and then **OK** to return to the **New Document** window.

![custom page size](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104511/1.1.2-1.png)

### Step 2

Set the **Margins** on all sides to **11 mm** and the **Bleed** to **5 mm**. Click **OK** to create the new document.

![new document window](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104512/1.2-1.png)

![new document](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104513/1.2.1-1.png)

We’ll work on the front cover design on **Page 1**—it’s always much easier to work on the front cover design alone at first. Then, a bit later, we’ll expand Page 2 of the document into the full cover, complete with spine and reverse, with the help of the Page Tool.

### Step 3

With the rulers visible **(View > Show Rulers)** click and drag a guide out from the left-hand ruler and drop it onto **Page 1** at **X position 66 mm**, which marks the center point of the page.

![controls panel](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104515/1.32.png)

![center point of cover](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104515/1.3.1-1.png)

## 3. Create a Seaworthy Backdrop

To recreate the murky, mysterious ocean setting of *Moby Dick*, we can give the whole cover a sea-green backdrop. Adding a gradient to the swatch will give the cover a bit more depth and interest.

### Step 1

Take the **Rectangle Tool (M)** and drag onto **Page 1**, across the whole page, extending up to the edges of the bleed on the top, right and bottom edges of the page. On the left edge, just extend to the edge of the page, not all the way to the bleed.

![rectangle tool](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104516/3.1-1.png)

### Step 2

Expand or open the **Swatches** panel **(Window > Color > Swatches).**

From the panel’s drop-down menu, choose **New Gradient Swatch.**

![new gradient swatch](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104517/3.2-2.png)

Name the swatch **Green Gradient** and set the **Type** to **Radial**.

Move down to the **Gradient Ramp** and click on the left-hand stop to be able to edit it. Choose **CMYK** for the **Stop Color** and set the levels to **C=89 M=49 Y=62 K=62.**

![green gradient](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104518/3.2.1-1.png)

Click on the right-hand stop and adjust the **Stop Color** to **Swatches**. Choose **[Black]** from the list below. Click **OK**.

![green gradient](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104519/3.2.2-1.png)

### Step 3

Apply the **Green Gradient** swatch to the **Fill Color** of the rectangle shape.

![green gradient applied to shape](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104521/3.3-1.png)

This will apply a lovely subtle gradient to the background of our front cover.

![completed backdrop](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104522/3.3.1-1.png)

## 4. Create a Whale Silhouette

### Step 1

Expand or open the **Layers** panel **(Window > Layers)** and double-click on the default ***Layer 1*** name. Rename the layer as ***Background Color*** and click **OK**.

![layer options](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104524/4.1-1.png)

Click on the **Create New Layer** button at the bottom right of the **Layers** panel to create a new layer. Double-click, and rename the layer as ***Graphics***.

![layer options](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104525/4.1.1-2.png)

Lock the bottom layer, ***Background Color***, by clicking in the blank space to the right of the eye icon, next to the name of the layer in the panel.

![layers panel](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104526/4.1.2-1.png)

### Step 2

Now we’re ready to start working on our whale graphic!

**File > Save As** your **InDesign** document, and minimize InDesign. Open up **Adobe Illustrator** and create a new document.

To make our collage-style whale, we need to first create a basic vector silhouette of the whale, and then, a bit later, we’ll fill it with a photo image.

![completed whale](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104527/4.22.png)

You can either draw the whale manually using the **Pen Tool (P)** in **Illustrator**, using photos of whales as a guide, or you can download a ready-made [vector image of a sperm whale](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/Sperm_whale_by_Rones.svg).

If you choose the latter, you’ll have to remove the stroke color of the sperm whale, get rid of any details and create a very simple black-filled silhouette of the whale shape, as in the example below.

![vector in illustrator](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104528/4.2.1-1.png)

### Step 3

Making sure your whale silhouette has only a simple black fill and no stroke color, select it, and then go up to **Edit > Copy** in Illustrator.

Return to your **InDesign** document and **Edit > Paste** the whale onto **Page 1** of your document. Hold **Shift** to adjust the scale of the pasted vector. Expand the whale so that its head fills the center of the page, as shown below, and so that the body extends past the left edge of the page, and past the edge of the pasteboard if needed. We want the whale to extend across the whole cover, including the spine and the reverse of the cover.

![pasted vector](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104529/4.32.png)

From the **Swatches** panel **(Window > Color > Swatches)**, set the **Fill Color** of the vector to **[None]** to get rid of the black fill.

![whale frame](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104530/4.3.12.png)

### Step 4

[Download sea image and return to your InDesign document.](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blue-and-white-ocean-756856.jpg)

![sea foam photo](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104531/4.4-1.jpg)

With the whale vector selected, go to **File > Place** and choose the sea foam image. Click **Open**.
Click on the **Fill Frame Proportionally** button in the top control panel to size the image to the frame. Double-click inside the whale to manually adjust the scale of the image, holding **Shift** while you do so, to make sure you’re happy with the effect. Make sure the image extends across the whole of the whale, right up to the edge of its tail.

![whale head](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104532/4.4.1-1.jpg)

### Step 5

Select the whale and **Edit > Copy, Edit > Paste**. Hold down **Shift** and reduce the whale in size until it’s just shy of the width of the page in length. **Edit > Copy** this smaller whale, so you keep a copy on your clipboard.

**Control-Click (Mac) or Right-Click (Windows) > Transform > Flip Horizontal**. Position this smaller whale at the top of the page, and allow it to cross over the top edge, so it doesn’t look too perfectly placed. You can rotate it a little too, so it doesn’t look quite as straight.

![flip horizontal](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104533/4.5-1.jpg)
![whale flipped](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104534/4.5.1-1.jpg)

Go to **Edit > Paste** to paste a copy of the smaller whale again. Position at the bottom-left of the page, just allowing the tail to appear on the page itself, as shown below.

![pasted whale](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104535/4.5.2-1.jpg)

## 5. Add Vintage Typography

### Step 1

Return to the **Layers** panel and create a new layer. Rename it ***Typography***.

![layer options](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104536/5.1-2.png)

Lock the ***Graphics*** layer and click on the ***Typography*** layer to activate it.

![layers panel](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104538/5.1.1-1.png)

Download and install these two (free!) fonts:

- [Leander](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/leander)
- [Oranienbaum](http://www.dafont.com/oranienbaum.font)

You’ll also need **Bodoni Std**, but this should be installed already in your InDesign font list. If it’s not, a great free alternative is [BodoniXT](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/BodoniXT).

### Step 2

Return to the **Swatches** panel and click on the **New Swatch** button at the bottom-right corner of the panel.

Double-click on the new swatch to open up the **Swatch Options** window. Rename the swatch as **Mint**, and set the **Color Type** to **Process** and **Color Mode** to **CMYK**. Set the levels to **C=54 M=9 Y=35 K=0.**

Click **OK** to add the revised swatch to the **Swatches** panel.

![mint swatch](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104538/5.2-1.png)

### Step 3

Select the **Type Tool (T)** and drag onto the top left of **Page 1** to create a text frame. Rest the left edge of the frame against the left-hand margin.

Type *‘Moby-Dick’* and, from either the **Character Formatting Controls** panel running along the top of the workspace or the **Character** panel **(Window > Type & Tables > Character)**, set the **Font** to **Oranienbaum, Size 55 pt.** Reduce the **Tracking** (space between all letters) to **-20**, and set the text to uppercase by clicking on the **All Caps** button in the **Controls** panel.

Adjust the **Font Color** to **Mint**.

![moby-dick title](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104540/5.3-1.png)

### Step 4

Return to the **Swatches** panel and create another new CMYK swatch, this time with the values **C=10 M=0 Y=13 K=0**. Rename the swatch as **Pale Mint.**

![pale mint](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104540/5.4-1.png)

Move down the page, and zoom into the right-hand edge, just where the whale’s mouth should be. Create a new smaller text frame and type in *‘or’.*

Set the **Font** to **Bodoni Std, Italic, Size 22 pt**, and increase the **Tracking** to **50**. From the **Paragraph Formatting Controls** panel at the top of the workspace, adjust the text to **Align Right.**

Set the **Font Color** to **Pale Mint.**

![or text](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104542/5.4.1-1.png)

### Step 5

Create another new swatch, this time called **Pale Lime**, and with the values **C=9 M=4 Y=21 K=0.**

![pale lime](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104542/5.5-1.png)

Create a new text frame and position it below the *‘or’* text frame, to the right side of the page. Type in *‘“The Whale”’* and set the **Font** to **Oranienbaum**, **Size 40 pt, Tracking -20** and **All Caps**. Set the text to **Align Right.**

Pull out *‘The Whale’* in the **Mint** swatch, and the apostrophes in the **Pale Lime** swatch.

![the whale title](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104544/5.5.1-1.png)
Of course, you can also export Page 1 of your document as an eBook cover (check the file format requirements of the eBook store before you upload it), but here I’ll walk you through the steps of exporting this as a print-ready file, which is suitable for sending to a professional book-printer.

### Step 1

Go to **File > Export**. Choose **Adobe PDF (Print)** from the **Format** drop-down menu. Click **Save**.

In the **Export Adobe PDF** window, choose **[Press Quality]** from the **Adobe PDF Preset** drop-down menu, and adjust the page range from **All** to **Range: 2**, just to export your full cover.

![press quality](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104605/7.12.jpg)

From the left-hand menu in the window, click on **Marks and Bleeds**. Check **All Printer’s Marks** and, under **Bleed and Slug, Use Document Bleed Settings.**

![marks and bleeds](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/17104606/7.1.1-1.jpg)

Click **Export** to create your print-ready cover.

Awesome!
