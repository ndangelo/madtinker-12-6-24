*What You’ll Be Creating*

It’s not always easy to find the perfect photo for a photo manipulation. For example, you might want to create a night scene, but the available photos are too dark or heavily edited. With Photoshop, you can transform a day scene into a night scene! This tutorial will guide you through adjusting brightness, adding stars, and creating convincing light sources.

## What You Will Need

You can use any photo for this exercise. If you'd like to follow along, find a suitable **village photo**.

## 1. How to Select the Sky

### Step 1
Open your photo in Photoshop. Take the **Magic Wand Tool (W)** and set **Tolerance** to **100**.

### Step 3
Enter **Quick Mask Mode (Q)** to refine the selection. Paint areas to add or subtract from the mask.

![Quick Mask Mode](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173725/day-to-night-1-3-min.jpg)

### Step 4
Exit Quick Mask Mode and go to **Select > Refine Edge**. Adjust sliders for a clean selection.

## 2. How to Darken the Sky

### Step 1
Open **Adjustments** and add a **Hue/Saturation** adjustment layer.

![Hue/Saturation Adjustment](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173736/day-to-night-2-1-min.png)

### Step 2
Clip the adjustment to the sky layer and lower **Lightness** to darken.

## 3. How to Create the Stars

### Step 1
Create a **New Layer** and fill it with black. Add noise using **Filter > Noise > Add Noise**.

![Add Noise](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173807/day-to-night-4-6-min.png)

### Step 2
Use **Filter Gallery** > **Sketch > Stamp** to create star shapes.

## 4. How to Illuminate the Windows

### Step 1
Select windows using the **Polygonal Lasso Tool (L)**.

![Select Windows](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173818/day-to-night-5-1-min.jpg)

### Step 2
Duplicate the selection and apply a **Color Overlay** with bright orange.

## 5. How to Add a New Light Source

### Step 1
Select a lantern shape using the **Polygonal Lasso Tool (L)**.

![Lantern Selection](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173836/day-to-night-6-1-min.jpg)

### Step 2
Duplicate the layer, apply a **Color Overlay** (white), and add an **Outer Glow** (bright orange).

![Glowing Lantern](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173848/day-to-night-6-8-min.jpg)


Add a **Layer Mask** to this layer and paint the shadows on it. Nothing detailed—just make sure the light doesn’t reach to the parts blocked from it. Use black to paint the shadows and white to remove them, until you are happy with the result.

### Step 9

Create a **New Layer** and take a bright orange again.

![bright orange color](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173904/day-to-night-6-17-min.jpg)

Subtly paint some highlights on the protruding elements of the building to keep them 3D.

![orange highlights on the wall](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173906/day-to-night-6-18-min.jpg)

### Step 10

Change the **Blend Mode** and add a **Layer Mask** to make the effect more subtle.

![blend mode to make subtle effect](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173907/day-to-night-6-19-min.jpg)

![layer mask for subtle effect](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173909/day-to-night-6-20-min.jpg)

### Step 11

Finally, **duplicate** the glow **(Control-J)** and change its color to white.

![color of glow](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173911/day-to-night-6-21-min.png)

Then remove it from the darker parts, leaving it only on the bright elements of the building. They should reflect more light and shouldn’t be so vividly colored.

![make dark invisible](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173913/day-to-night-6-22-min.png)

![white elements brightened](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173914/day-to-night-6-21-min.jpg)

Change the **Blend Mode** and lower the **Opacity** to adjust the intensity of this effect.

![adjust intensity with blend mode and opacity](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173916/day-to-night-6-23-min.jpg)

## 6. How to Add a Late Dusk/Early Dawn Effect

### Step 1

Let’s adjust the final brightness of the scene now, since we have it all together. Go to the top of the layers and add a new Adjustment Layer: **Levels**.

![levels adjustment layer](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173917/day-to-night-7-1-min.png)

Drag the white marker to the left to increase the amount of bright shades in the scene.

![more brightness in the scene](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173919/day-to-night-7-2-min.png)

![photo with levels adjusted](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173920/day-to-night-7-3-min.jpg)

### Step 2

Create a **New Layer**. **Fill** it with black, and then go to its **Blending Options** and add **Gradient Overlay**.

![gradient overlay](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173922/day-to-night-7-4-min.png)

Give it the colors of a low sun.

![sunset gradient](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173924/day-to-night-7-5-min.png)

![sunset sunrise color gradient](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173926/day-to-night-7-6-min.png)

### Step 3

Hold **Control** and click the sky layer to get its outline.

![part of layer selected](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173929/day-to-night-7-8-min.jpg)

### Step 4

Click the gradient layer and add a **Layer Mask**. The selection will be automatically applied to the mask.

![selection applied to layer mask](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173931/day-to-night-7-9-min.jpg)

Paint on the mask to reveal the mountains in the background.

![layer mask painting](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173933/day-to-night-7-10-min.jpg)

### Step 5

**Duplicate** the sky **(Control-J)** and drag it to the top. We’re going to add special effects to the clouds.

![copy sky](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173934/day-to-night-7-11-min.jpg)

Add a **Hue/Saturation** adjustment.

![hue saturation adjustments panel](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173936/day-to-night-7-12-min.png)

Clip the **Adjustment Layer** to the duplicated sky, desaturate it, and make it slightly brighter.

![how to use hue saturation adjustment](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173938/day-to-night-7-13-min.png)

![desaturated sky](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173939/day-to-night-7-14-min.jpg)

### Step 6

Add a **Levels** adjustment, clip it, and add more contrast to the sky with it.

![levels contrast](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173941/day-to-night-7-16-min.png)

![contrasting clouds](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173943/day-to-night-7-15-min.jpg)

### Step 7

Select all three layers (the sky and its Adjustment Layers) and **Merge** them **(Control-E)**. Then go to the **Blending Options** of this new layer and remove it from the bright parts of the sky using the lower white marker. Change its **Blend Mode** to **Soft Light** and lower the **Opacity**.

![blend if adjusting transparency](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173945/day-to-night-7-18-min.png)

![sky adjusted](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173947/day-to-night-7-19-min.jpg)

### Step 8

**Duplicate (Control-J)** the layer and play with its **Blending Options** too, this time removing it from the dark parts of the sky (the lower black marker). Change the **Blend Mode** to **Soft Light** as well, but leave the **Opacity** at **100%**, adjusting it with a layer mask if needed.

![adjusting transparency of layer](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173948/day-to-night-7-20-min.png)

![layer transparency adjusted](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173950/day-to-night-7-22-min.jpg)

### Step 9

Time for some final adjustments. Add an **Exposure** adjustment on top to play with the overall brightness.

![exposure adjustment](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2017/11/26173952/day-to-night-7-23-min.png)

I’ve also decided to drag the sky slightly down to make the change of the colors more gradual (you can do it with a smart use of Layer Masks).
