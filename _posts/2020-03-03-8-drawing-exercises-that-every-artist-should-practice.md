### Continuous Contour Line Drawing

A Continuous Contour Line Drawing is an exercise to help us focus on the line. The idea here is to create a drawing where you never lift your drawing utensil from the paper. If you have never done this exercise you may find your drawings odd and “imperfect” but that is what makes them beautiful. Also focus on looking at what you are drawing as much as the drawing itself and do not stop moving your hand when you look up

### Continuous Blind Contour Line Drawing

If you enjoy the contour line exercise, then you should certainly try this one. In this exercise, look only at the subject that you are drawing and not at the paper. The idea here is to train your hand and eyes to work in unison. As you do more blind contour line drawings you will get better and begin seeing some wonderful, fluid lines

### Gesture Drawing

The one on the right is an example of tighter more expressive execution  
In this exercise you want to get as much information down on the paper in short amount of time. You will be doing a series of drawings here, so make sure you have plenty of paper and a timer on hand. The first drawings you only have 20 seconds to complete.

Repeat the 20-second drawings about 10 times and increase the timer to 40 seconds. You want to be bold with these drawings and forget about the “mistakes” that you are making.

You should begin to notice an improvement in your line quality and become more confident with your drawing. Focus on looking at what you are drawing as much as the drawing itself and do not stop moving your hand when you look up.

### Draw the Negative Space

In this exercise you will be drawing the space around the object, negative space, rather than the object itself. First try using a solid marking as shown above to create a very flat looking finished product.

### Value Drawing Exercise

Usually, when drawing we begin sketching the outline of the object we are drawing. In this exercise, do not draw a single line. Instead, simply shade using your favorite drawing utensil and build the drawing up this way. You should still be looking at what you are drawing as much as the drawing itself and do not stop moving your hand when you look up.
