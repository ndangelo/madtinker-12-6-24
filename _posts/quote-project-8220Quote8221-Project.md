**Project: 1**

In this **exercise**, find a quote that you may have heard or that you like. Using just a sentence or two from the quote, design a graphic that conveys the feeling of your quote. You can use anything to design your **graphic; paper, pens, markers, Photoshop, Illustrator**. It’s entirely up to you.

You may choose your own dimensions for each project. You could do a banner, a Poster (2’x3′ or 3’x2′), Standard letter (8.5″x11″), or a postcard. These are just a few suggestions.

**Complete two layouts. One solely in Illustrator, and one in Photoshop.**

You have the rest of today and Thursday to complete these.

**Sample Quote:**

*“Hold fast to dreams, for if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly.” –Langston Hughes.*
