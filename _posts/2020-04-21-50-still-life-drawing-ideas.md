![50+ Still life ideas for high school Art students](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140238/still-life-drawing-ideas-high-school-2.jpg) **What is a still life?** Here is a definition provided by [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_life):

> A work of art depicting mostly inanimate subject matter, typically commonplace objects which may be either natural or man-made

- Viewable first-hand
- Visually interesting, with a range of different textures, reflections, surfaces and forms
- Small enough to set up and arrange in the classroom (light, easily moveable)
- Able to arranged in different ways, creating original compositions so that multiple exciting works can be created
- Durable enough to be handled safely by enthusiastic teenagers (without sharp or dangerous parts, for example)
- Able to stored from lesson to lesson without eroding, decaying or breaking (this is not necessary if the still life can be drawn within a single lesson or photographed for completion at a later date)
- Appropriate for younger students to view (i.e. not offensive)

### 50+ Still Life Drawing Ideas

**Popcorn**, as in these original still life artworks by Po Yuan (left) and Betty Chen (right), students of [Elizabeth Jendek](http://www.elizabethjendek-visualarts.com/), [Thai Chinese International School](http://www.tcis.ac.th/), Samutprakarn, Thailand:

![popcorn still life drawing](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140239/popcorn-still-life-drawing-1.jpg)  
Although there is a distinct possibility that a number of still life items might mysteriously ‘disappear’ during the course of this lesson, popcorn provides an excellent opportunity for practicing the application of tone. Completed in charcoal, these large works create a kind of semi-abstracted landscapes and require careful attention to light and shadow.

**Crumpled paper bags**, such as this work by 18-year-old artist [Raegan Koepsel](https://instagram.com/p/wMdhilI-jt/):  
![paper bag drawing](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140239/drawing-paper-bags-1.jpg)  
Crunched and creased paper bags create dramatic shadows and provide an excellent opportunity to learn about tone. This is a great subject to draw with charcoal on mid-tone grey or brown paper. In this example, the paper bags have been twisted in different ways and carefully contrasted with a background of corrugated cardboard.

**Styrofoam cups**, as inspired by this activity by the [DC Sketchers](http://www.eastcityart.com/uncategorized/dc-sketchers-the-perception-of-spaces-relationships-via-styrofoam-cups/):  
![drawing ellipses: Styrofoam cups](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140240/drawing-ellipses-1.jpg)  
This is an excellent drawing activity to help students understand how to represent ellipses (the oval shape that is visible when a circle is viewed from an angle). The hollow truncated cones become surrounded by shadows and beautiful pockets of curving negative space, creating a superb still life drawing lesson. Photo courtesy of East City Art.

**Machinery and mechanical parts**, such as old sewing machines, disassembled clocks, cogs/wheels, and typewriters, inspired by this drawing from Parkway North High School, United States, taught by Art teacher and artist [Grant Kniffen](http://www.pkwy.k12.mo.us/north/teachers/gkniffen/AP%20Studio/APStudio.htm):  
![typewriter drawing - great still life idea](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140241/typewriter-drawing-1.jpg)  
When the inner workings of mechanical items are exposed, there are often endless opportunities for art-making. In this observational drawing, the complex letter keys, crunched paper, and detailed ink ribbon contrast the smooth surfaces of the typewriter and tabletop.

**Driftwood, rope, and fishing accessories**, as inspired by these Roy Lichtenstein still life compositions (images © [Estate of Roy Lichtenstein](http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/)):  
![Roy Lichtenstein still life](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140242/roy-lichtenstein-still-life-1.jpg)  
Many high school art projects within New Zealand are based around the beach and coastline. Items such as rope, floats, hooks, anchors, driftwood, and fishing nets provide excellent subject matter for still life works due to the variety of shapes, forms, patterns, and surface textures. These two works by American Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein, ‘Cape Cod Still Life’ and ‘Cape Cod Still Life (Study),’ show nets and rope entangled around driftwood and shells. The bottom work is an oil and Magna (a brand of acrylic resin paint) completed in 1972, with a drawn composition study above.

![drawing of crustaceans - IGCSE Art](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140243/crustaceans-IGCSE-art-1.jpg)  
Still life paintings of fish and other sea creatures can make for an exciting lesson – especially when the real items are slapped onto the center of tables in the art room (it may be worth checking out where these can be stored in between class – staff rooms may have space in the freezer)!

![microscope still life drawing](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140244/microscope-drawing-1.jpg)  
Drawing exercises such as this can be a great way for making connections between other subject areas within the school. In this case, it might be possible to mimic a scientific experiment that students are currently learning about. Note the stunning composition in this work, with the combination of slightly curving textbook images and text providing an appropriate background to the detailed three-dimensional microscope.

![line weight still life drawings](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140245/line-weight-still-life-1.jpg)  
Wooden mannequins can be great still life additions, posed as if the figure is interacting/responding to its environment. In this still life drawing lesson, varied line weight has been used to create depth and focal areas within the work.

**Armchairs, chairs, or stools**, as in this example by [Daniel E. Munoz-Vidal](http://dmunozvidal18.blogspot.co.nz/2010/11/chairs.html):  
![drawing of chairs](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140246/drawing-of-chairs-1.jpg)  
Art classes may only have access to mundane stools. Sometimes, however, an art teacher will acquire an old chair, sofa, or carved wooden chair that can become a permanent addition to the still life collection. In this well-composed drawing, chairs and tables have been positioned so that their forms intersect and slice up the page.

**Dolls, train sets, and other toys**, such as this observational drawing of a teddy bear completed as part of an AQA [GCSE Art and Design project](https://www.studentartguide.com/gallery/memories) by student [Holly Reynolds](https://www.facebook.com/hollyreynoldsart):  
![teddy bear drawing](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140247/teddy-bear-drawing-1.jpg)  
Still life paintings of toys are a popular choice among middle and high school art students. Although there can be risks with drawing cartoon-like toys or those with distorted proportions (it can be difficult for an examiner to tell whether the drawing is badly proportioned rather than the toy itself), items such as old and broken dolls, ancient teddy bears, and intricate train sets make excellent still life material. This A3 drawing by Holly was completed from first-hand observation in response to the topic "Memories," using a range of graphite pencils (5H – 9B) and a putty eraser.

**Bottles, vases, jugs, and vessels** (this topic was inspired by a [Highcrest Academy Art Department Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/highcrestart/bottles-vases-vessels/)), such as the famous [Giorgio Morandi](http://www.nyartbeat.com/event/2008/E8D6) still life drawings, etchings, and paintings:  
![Giorgio Morandi still life](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140247/giorgio-morandi-still-life-drawings-e1439893351440-1.jpg)  
Giorgio Morandi, a famous still life artist who died in 1964, is well known for his deceptively simple still life artworks, which repeat many familiar household items such as vases, bowls, and bottles. Morandi positions these with careful precision, with each object treated as if it were a sculptural entity: a formal exploration of space and form. His paintings, in particular, have a subtle use of tone. The 1928 etching above, titled “Grande natura morta con la lampada a destra,” may inspire students to produce pen drawings that have a similar cross-hatching aesthetic.

**Empty boxes**, inspired by a drawing exercise completed by a student of [Nicole Havekost](http://nikimade.com/drawing/):  
![Still life of empty boxes](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140248/still-life-empty-boxes-1.jpg)  
Boxes provide a great contemporary still life object. At first glance, boxes seem simple to draw; they are comprised of primarily straight lines and flat planes with little detail; however, this task demands a good understanding of perspective and challenges students to use their eyes to observe the variation in tone. Previously unnoticed details, such as creases, text, and peeling edges of cellophane tape, begin to jump into vision. This activity could be presented as a quick still life gesture drawing or a meticulous, detailed observation of angles, planes, light, and form.

**Jewelry and treasure boxes**, as in these still life paintings by [IGCSE Art and Design](https://www.studentartguide.com/featured/a-igcse-art-coursework) student Nikau Hindin, ACG Parnell College:  
![jewelry still life](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140249/jewellery-still-life-1.jpg)  
This work was produced within several drawing lessons that asked students to create still life paintings with dark backgrounds (such as the necklace shown on black acrylic paint) and work over other prepared grounds (for example, the still life on the left is completed using Carandache crayon upon watered-down acrylic). The jewelry boxes provide students with the opportunity to represent three-dimensional space, while the jewelry itself adds glistening, detailed focal areas within the work.

**Preserved animals and other specimens in jars**, such as these modern still life artworks by [Cindy Wright](http://www.cindywright.org/):  
![Cindy Wright still life paintings](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140250/cindy-wright-paintings-1.jpg)  
In addition to insects, science departments often have wonderful preserved animal specimens that make for great still life subjects. If these are unavailable, you might wish to create your own dramatic interpretation, based on the still life compositions above by Cindy Wright. These works force us to meet the lifeless gaze of gutted fish coiled within a glass fish bowl.

**Fruit and vegetables**, inspired by [Paul Cezanne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne)’s still life with apples:  
![Cezanne still life with apples](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140251/cezanne-still-life-with-apples-1.jpg)  
Fruit and vegetables are inexpensive enough that large quantities can be purchased for classroom use, allowing students to organize the still life arrangements themselves or in small groups. Dedicated students may bring more unusual items from home. Although a still life comprised of fresh food is unlikely to last longer than a week (less within rambunctious classrooms), vegetables such as garlic, potatoes, onions, gourds, and pumpkins can be kept for a much longer duration. There is also the opportunity to include wooden tables and other still life items in the background. These famous still life paintings by Paul Cezanne are titled *Rideau, Cruchon et Compotier* (which means Curtain, Jug, and Fruit Bowl) and *The Basket of Apples.* Both still life paintings are completed using oil on canvas in the 1890s and judged by some to be among the best still life paintings ever.

**Vintage cameras**, as in these collection of observational drawings by Year 9 student Dougal Burden from [Takapuna Grammar School](http://www.takapuna.school.nz/):  
![vintage camera drawings](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140252/vintage-camera-drawings-1.jpg)  
This exercise introduces students to different mediums and provides experience rendering a range of different reflective, smooth, and faintly textured man-made surfaces. It also provides a great way to spark other Visual Art interests and share knowledge about early photographic techniques.

**A glass of water**, such as this example by [Hanna Asfour](http://www.touchtalent.com/3d-art/art/Glass-of-water-realistic-pencil-drawing-294896):  
![glass of water](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140253/glass-of-water-drawing-1.jpg)  
This drawing lesson focuses on capturing the reflections, distortions, and transparency of glass and water, making it a challenging yet rewarding task for developing observation skills.

**A glass of water**, such as this example by Hanna Asfour:  
![drawing a glass of water](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140253/glass-water-drawing-1.jpg)  
Although it is virtually impossible for a high school class to get to the end of a water-based lesson without somebody spilling something, this exercise can be a stunning and challenging task that really helps conquer the fear of transparent surfaces head-on. With good lighting, this task allows students to render the glass, water, and the sparkling tonal variations within the shadow. A task of this nature can be a great one-lesson activity, perhaps set as a ‘test’ or one-off assignment.

**A jug and cup of tea**, with inspiration from cubist still life paintings by Juan Gris:  
![Juan Gris still life](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140254/juan-gris-still-life-1.jpg)  
After preparing the drawing surface with a painted ground and glued-down paper (some of which may have decorative patterns that mimic wood grain or a tablecloth, for example), students may overlay fragments of observational drawings, from slightly distorted angles, with tone softly applied in the style of Juan Gris. This synthetic cubist piece was completed in 1914 using oil and mixed media and is titled "Breakfast."

**Marbles, spheres, and balls**, inspired by Pedro Campos paintings:  
![Pedro Campos paintings](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140254/pedro-campos-paintings-1.jpg)  
Well-known contemporary still life artist Pedro Campos creates hyper-realistic still life paintings, such as the marble and golf ball oil on canvas work, *Camp Creek.* Drawing marbles and other spherical objects challenges students to focus all their attention on color, tone, and surface; capturing glistening reflections and textural variations to enhance the illusion of reality.

**Shells**, as in these artworks from the students of Elizabeth Jendek:  
![Drawing shells: art lesson](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140255/shells-art-lesson-1.jpg)  
In addition to providing a wealth of visually interesting forms, shells are durable enough to survive the energy of a high school Art classroom. In this stunning unit of work, students have produced vibrant, high-contrast oil pastel artworks. These works were completed after formally analyzing the work of Georgia O’Keeffe, working first-hand from still life arrangements and mirrors to help generate complex compositions.

**Insects**, as shown in these stunning examples:  
![Art lesson: drawing insects](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140256/drawing-insects-bugs-1.jpg)  
Drawing insects can be challenging due to difficulty sourcing first-hand imagery. It is sometimes possible to purchase dried and preserved insects in display cases and to use a magnifying glass to make the task of observing details easier. These examples have been completed using black pen applied in dots (stippled) to a watercolor ground.

**Plants and cacti**, as inspired by Laura Garcia Serventi:  
![Painting of plants and cacti](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140257/cacti-painting-1.jpg)  
With an appropriate selection of plants (ideally those that can survive long periods without attentive care) and interestingly shaped plant pots, this can form the basis of a great still life painting lesson plan. These works by Laura Garcia Serventi include a variety of contrasting plant forms and flowers, with different subtle patterns, pots positioned on a dramatic tiled floor.

**Origami or folded paper**, inspired by this observational drawing by Sean Dooley:  
![Paper crane drawing](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140258/paper-crane-drawing-1.jpg)  
Folding paper can create stunning shadows and a mesh of intriguing angular lines. This example involves students first constructing origami before producing observational drawings in a range of different media.

**Bones and skeletons**, as in this example by Year 11 student Manisha Mistry:  
![IGCSE Art sketchbook bones](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140259/GCSE-art-sketchbook-bones-1.jpg)  
Bones and skeletons provide intricate forms and dramatic contrasts. This example showcases observational drawings executed in a range of mediums, forming part of a larger art project.

**Complex interiors and window panes**, as in this Henri Matisse still life:  
![Henri Matisse still life](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140300/henri-matisse-still-life-1.jpg)  
Titled *Still Life after Jan Davidsz De Heem’s ‘La Desserte,’* this painting is Matisse’s interpretation of a seventeenth-century work. The background may take on equal importance with the central still life, with open windows and table surfaces becoming prominent parts of the composition.

**Old shoes and sandals**, inspired by Vincent van Gogh:  
![Vincent van Gogh, still life with shoes](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140303/van-gogh-still-life-shoes-1.jpg)  
The traditional ‘still life with old shoe’ remains a popular choice among art students. These van Gogh still life paintings include *A Pair of Shoes* and *Three Pairs of Shoes,* completed in the 1880s.

**Art-making equipment**, as demonstrated by Gayle Bicknell:  
![Still life ideas - art equipment and tools](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140304/tool-drawing-ideas-1.jpg)  
This topic lends itself to Jim Dine-inspired charcoal still life drawings. This teaching example includes graphite drawings of art tools over collaged backgrounds.

**Woodworking tools**, inspired by a teaching exercise by Jaime Brett Treadwell:  
![Jim Dine tools art project](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140305/jim-dine-tools-project-1.jpg)  
Students arrange tools with an angled light source to create interesting shadows, selecting compositions that emphasize positive and negative spaces.

**Flax weaving**, as demonstrated in this lesson:  
![Flax weaving drawing](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140306/flax-weaving-drawing-1.jpg)  
Students research traditional flax weaving methods, create their own experimental weaving, and produce observational drawings. This provides opportunities for blending colors and working with textures.

**Musical instruments**, as inspired by Pieter Claesz vanitas still lifes.  


![Pieter Claesz vanitas still life](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140307/pieter-claesz-vanitas-still-life-1.jpg)
High school Music Departments are sometimes willing to lend instruments that can be used in still life displays; with instruments overlapping in order to create interesting shadows, as in the detail of the oil painting above by Pieter Claesz. This work is titled ‘Vanitas Still Life with the Spinario’ and was painted in 1628.

![Dutch still life examples](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140308/dutch-still-life-examples-1.jpg)
Beautiful old books can often be purchased from second-hand shops. School English, Geography, Science and History Departments also may have great old textbooks that have been discarded by past students or are no longer used. Many of these may have student graphite, dates or other annotation in them that can provide welcome variety and visual interest in still life drawings and paintings of books.

![Vincent van Gogh sunflowers](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140308/vincent-van-gogh-sunflowers-1.jpg)
A drawing of flowers can become cliché, ‘pretty’ or uninspiring (adding to the endless formulaic roses, hibiscus or lily flower drawings that fill the world). Extreme care should be taken to guide students away from ‘rote’ or ‘formulaic’ drawing, where the flower is drawn from memory or step-by-step according to some predetermined pattern, without first-hand observation of form or tone. You might choose uncommon flowers, or those that are damaged, dried or decayed, for example. Rather than in a flower pot or vase, the flowers might be scattered upon the ground, as in ‘Four cut sunflowers’ by van Gogh above. It is also worth noting that flower still life drawings and paintings can also be a hit with family members, with many parents enthusiastically displaying flower drawings (much more so than with some of the other still life suggestions on this page)!

![charcoal lamp drawing](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140309/charcoal-lamp-drawing-1.jpg)
In addition to transparency and curving reflective surfaces, these still life objects often have thin wires and/or power cords – and often emit light themselves – making them an extra challenging and exciting object to draw.

![Tom Wesselmann still life](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140310/tom-wesselmann-still-life-1.jpg)
Collections of popular contemporary foodstuffs – bright packages and eye-catching labels – can be used to create stunning compositions, as in this Tom Wesselmann still life. Many of these ‘pop objects’ have the benefit that they are packaged and long-lasting, able to be stored for some time in an Art room cupboard.

![Chardin still life](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140311/chardin-still-life-1.jpg)
Although Art students are often masters of the cluttered desk syndrome, this task can be set up within a classroom with more purpose, so that the selected objects are part of a narrative, whereby the composition conveys a particular backstory and meaning. In this Chardin still life, titled ‘The Attributes of the Arts and the Rewards Which Are Accorded Them’, completed using oil on canvas, objects have been selected to represent various artistic disciplines – painting, drawing, architecture and sculpture – and are arranged alongside a ribbon with a cross, the highest award an artist in this region and time could apparently receive. The work was completed using oil on canvas in 1766.

![still life painting ideas](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140312/jean-francois-de-le-motte-1.jpg)
Still life arrangements can be easily pinned to classroom pinboards. This painting, completed in 1670, includes a painting within a painting, a letter to the artist, a printed pamphlet, and an accounting booklet.

![drawing of eggs](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140313/drawing-of-eggs-1.jpg)
Students throughout the ages have voiced their frustration when they are set the task of applying tone to drawings of eggs, however almost all see the value of the exercise when the work is complete. This still life activity involves a contrast of textures, with the smooth eggs resting on textured cloth or crumpled paper towel to create a visually pleasing composition. Another variation involves drawing open eggshells, with light falling across the concave and convex surfaces.

![drawing litter](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140313/drawing-litter-1.jpg)
Samples of litter and other remains, such as orange peelings, banana skins, and apple cores, can make excellent still life subjects. This work was completed using black Indian ink and water on wet-strength cartridge paper. It was completed within one hour.

![Seed pod drawings](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140314/still-life-seedpods-1.jpg)
Seedpods come in many intriguing organic shapes and forms. They typically last for a long time and are readily available – often in the schoolyard itself.

![still life: drapery and clothing](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140315/still-life-drapery-1.jpg)
Shirts, dresses, and other clothing items, which might include coat hangers, zips, buttons, belts, buckles, items of adornment, as well as traditional costumes, offer the opportunity to draw draped folded fabric alongside more complex accessories, pleats, seams, and textile details. In the exercise above, students produce realistic drawings of a personal item of clothing that are pinned to a display panel (the panel can be shifted aside and placed in storage until the next class).

![hanging still life](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140316/hanging-still-life-1.jpg)
A still life composition that is created from hanging objects has the presence of the string to create tension and linear elements, alongside unexpected shadows, angles, and alignment of objects. It can also result in dramatic contemporary imagery, as students hang and explore unusual subject matter.

![drawing cutlery](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/21140317/drawing-cutlery-1.jpg)
This exercise is one of the most challenging on this list. The still life drawing combines reflective surfaces, convex and concave forms with small details, and knotted string.
