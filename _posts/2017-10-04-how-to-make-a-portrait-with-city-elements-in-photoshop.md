## Tutorial Steps

### Step 1: Prepare the Model

1. Create a new document (907px x 1380px, white background).
2. Load and cut out the model, then paste it onto the canvas.
3. Use cloud brushes as erasers around the model's hair and shoulders. Soften the lower parts to make space for additional elements.

### Step 2: Add Adjustment Layers

* **Black and White:** Apply as a clipping mask, erasing portions with the splatter brush for effect.  
* **Curves:** Adjust for better contrast.

Paint a cloud effect on a new layer below the model using the cloud brush.

2. Use the splatter brush to erase parts of the building for a seamless blend.
3. Apply the following adjustments as clipping masks:

   * **Black and White**
   * **Levels**
   * **Curves**

### Step 4: Integrate Additional Buildings

2. Adjust its shape using the Free Transform tool and blend it into the model.
3. Add adjustments (Black and White, Levels) to match the tone.

### Step 5: Add Roads and Signs

2. Apply adjustments (Black and White, Levels, Curves) for a cohesive look.
