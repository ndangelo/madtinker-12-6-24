## **Client/Brand**

Renault SA [https://www.renault.co.za](https://www.renault.co.za/)

## **Timeline**

1–2 weeks. The project is expected to be completed within two weeks.

## **Objectives**

We are looking to redesign the official Renault website in South Africa. The site should provide a seamless experience for potential customers to browse our catalogue, book a test drive and purchase vehicles from our dealership. The website will be the primary sales tool for our business, and we want it to be easy to use, informative and visually appealing.

- **Success Metrics to Consider:**
- Conversion rate: The percentage of website visitors who purchase a vehicle or schedule a test drive.
- User engagement: The amount of time visitors spend on the website and the number of pages they visit.
- Search performance: The number of visitors who use the search function and the accuracy of the search results.
- Customer satisfaction: Feedback from customers who use the website to purchase a vehicle or schedule a test drive.

This is the current site:

A quick and easy way to search for cars that fit his budget and preferences. He is also interested in finance and insurance options that can be bundled with his purchase. The schedule is very tight, and he doesn’t want to be haggled by salespeople at a dealership.

**Sarah, 28 | First-time Car Buyer**  
NEEDS  
She needs guidance and information about the car-buying process. She also wants to compare different models and prices to make an informed decision. She is unfamiliar with the technical terms used in the car industry, which can overwhelm her. She is also on a tight budget and needs to find a car that is affordable but still reliable.

**Robert, 50 | Experienced Car Enthusiast**  
NEEDS  
He is looking for a dealership that specializes in luxury cars and can provide him with personalized service. He is interested in the latest models and technology features. Robert has high expectations and wants to be treated like a VIP. He is not interested in mass-produced cars and wants a dealership that can provide him with unique and exclusive options.

## Specifications/ Limitations

The site must load quickly; hence, any large interactions must be kept to a minimum.
