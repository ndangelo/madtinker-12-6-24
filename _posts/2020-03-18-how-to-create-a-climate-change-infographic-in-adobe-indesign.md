2. Organize layers:  
   - Rename **Layer 1** to `Background`.  
   - Add two more layers: `Photo` and `Typography`.  
   - Lock all layers except `Background`.

3. Create a color palette in **Swatches**:  
   Add colors using these RGB values:

2. Add gradient fills:  
   - Top: Pale sea-blue to deep blue.  
   - Bottom: Dark peach to beige for a sandy effect.  

3. Create an iceberg effect using the **Pen Tool** with a **Paper** fill and textured stroke.

---

## 3. How to Edit the Photo for Your Infographic

1. Open the polar bear photo in **Photoshop**.  
   - Isolate the bear using the **Lasso Tool** and **Refine Edge**.  
   - Convert to black and white using **Channel Mixer**.

2. Save as a `.psd` file and place in your InDesign layout.

You can create ‘pointers’ for items of text by using the **Line Tool ()**. In the **Stroke** panel, set the **Type** to **CircleSolid**.

![circle solid](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120315/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.13.12-2.jpg)

**Credits**: Source for all statistics available upon request.

### Step 5

You can create arrows by using the Line Tool and Stroke panel. However, I generally prefer using the Line Tool to create both the stem and arrowhead for precise proportions.

![arrow](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120317/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.16.28-2.jpg)

Here, I created an arrow to the right of the polar bear and set a statistic in **Charlevoix Pro Bold** within a text frame. The **Font Color** was adjusted to **Heat Gradient** for added emphasis.

![heat gradient](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120319/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.18.22-2.jpg)

Additional text surrounding the key statistic is styled with **Charlevoix Pro Regular** and the **\[Paper\] Font Color** for balance.

![text frame](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120320/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.20.03-2.jpg)

### Step 6

After designing one statistic, copy and paste it to replicate for others. Place the elements onto the infographic sections, adjusting the content and **Font Color** as needed.

![text frame](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120321/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.21.59-2.jpg)

Once satisfied, vectorize the text by selecting **Type > Create Outlines**. Note: This locks the formatting, so keep a backup copy of editable text for adjustments.

![create outlines](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120323/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.23.40-2.jpg)

### Step 7

Enhance your infographic by adding icons. Open a vector set in Illustrator, then copy and paste desired icons. Adjust icon **Fill** to match your design.

![weight icon](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120324/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.25.45-2.jpg)

Pair icons with arrows, text, and contrasting key figures for emphasis.

![statistic](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120325/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.26.28-2.jpg)

### Step 8

Create section arrow icons with the **Ellipse Tool (L)** and **Shift** key for a circle. Use the **Pen Tool (P)** for a simple arrowhead within the circle.

![circle](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120326/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.27.22-2.jpg)

Group the elements (**Right-Click > Group**) for easy replication.

![group](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120331/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.28.08-2.jpg)

Build up the infographic with varied **Font Colors** for contrast and interest.

![statistic](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120332/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.28.40-2.jpg)

### Step 9

Continue to refine your infographic, focusing on clarity, visual balance, and informational accuracy.

To create a pie chart, we’ll need the brief help of Illustrator. Minimize your InDesign document, and open up **Illustrator**.

Use the **Ellipse Tool (L)** and hold **Shift** to create a circle on the artboard, setting it to have no fill and a thick stroke (around **50 pt**).

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![circle](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120333/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.35.39-2.jpg)</figure></div>Go to **Object &gt; Path &gt; Outline Stroke.**

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![outline stroke](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120335/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.36.15-2.jpg)</figure></div>Then head up to **Edit &gt; Copy.**

### Step 10

Please return to your **InDesign** document and **Edit &gt; Paste** the circle onto the page, setting it in the center of a colored section. Adjust the color to a pale swatch.

![white circle](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120336/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.36.40-2.jpg)

**Edit > Paste, Edit > Paste in Place** the circle directly on top of the first, and adjust the color to a contrasting swatch.

![brown circle](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120337/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.39.46-2.jpg)

Then take the **Scissors Tool (C)** and snip away at the sides of the circle on top, isolating a section of the ‘pie’ to roughly match the percentage of your statistic.

![cut out section](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120338/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.41.24-2.jpg)

![percentage](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120340/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.42.11-2.jpg)

### Step 11

You can also add bar charts to your infographic, which are easier to do directly in InDesign.

First, use the **Line Tool ()** to create two arrows, one pointing upwards and the other pointing right.

![arrows](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120341/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.42.56-2.jpg)

Then use the **Rectangle Tool (M)** to create ‘bars’ on the chart. You can soften these corners by going to **Object > Corner Options** and setting the **Shape** to **Rounded**.

![rounded corners](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120342/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.43.41-2.jpg)

Add captions under the lower arrow and above each bar if you wish.

![captions](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120343/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.44.23-2.jpg)

I’ve used the **Flood Gradient** swatch to make the main title of the bar chart really stand out.

![flood gradient](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120344/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.44.50-2.jpg)

![flooding chart final](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120346/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.45.05-2.jpg)

## 5. How to Export Your Design for Web

### Step 1

When you’ve finished your infographic design, make sure to **File > Save** all your hard work.

To export the design ready for sharing online, head up to **File > Export.** Choose **JPEG** or **PNG** from the **Format** menu at the bottom of the window, and give the image a suitable name.

![png export](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120347/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.45.55-2.jpg)

Click **Save**.

### Step 2

In the export options window, you can adjust the image settings to make it suitable for uploading online. Adjust the Quality to Medium or High, set the Resolution to 72 ppi, and ensure the **Color Space** is set to **RGB**.

![export png](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/06120349/Screen20Shot202017-11-2120at2016.46.10-2.jpg)

Finally, click **Export** to create your web-ready image.

Awesome job! Your infographic is finished!

## Conclusion: Your Finished Infographic

With your infographic exported, it’s time to get it up online and spread the word about the impact of global warming on climate and environmental change. Or why not print it out and post it up on the noticeboard at your college or workplace?
