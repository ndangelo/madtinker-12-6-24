Tired of using stock silhouettes? I feel you. As designers, we like to be unique and special. Having our own stock vectors is always a good idea.

I used to download stock vectors all the time, well, the free ones. Being a graphic design student in college, I couldnâ€™t afford to pay for every single vector for my school project. So I really took the time to create my own silhouettes.

And plus, thatâ€™s what Adobe Illustrator is good at. Iâ€™ve been using Illustrator for over ten years now, I found some effective ways to make silhouettes for my artwork.

## 2 Easy Ways to Make a Silhouette in Adobe Illustrator

*Note: Screenshots are taken from Illustrator CC Mac Version. Windows and other versions might look slightly different.*

There are several ways to make silhouettes in Adobe Illustrator. **[Image Trace](https://illustratorhow.com/image-trace/)** and the **[Pen Tool](https://illustratorhow.com/how-to-use-pen-tool/)** are commonly used for this purpose. The pen tool is great for making a simple silhouette shape, and Image Trace is best for creating silhouettes from a complex image.

For example, itâ€™ll take you forever to make a silhouette of this coconut tree if you use the pen tool to outline because there are so many complicated details. But using the Image Trace, you can do it in a minute.

### Method 1: Image Trace 

This is, letâ€™s say, the standard way to make a silhouette in Illustrator. I totally agree that itâ€™s an effective way 90% of the time. The Silhouettes option is right there, but you canâ€™t always get what you want with one single click. Sometimes youâ€™ll have to adjust some settings manually.

Iâ€™ll continue with the example of this coconut tree image.

**Step 1**: Place the image in an Illustrator document.

**Step 2**: Select the image and click **Trace Image** under the properties panel Quick Actions section.

**Step 3**: Click **Silhouettes**.

You see what Iâ€™m talking about? You canâ€™t always get the best result at once.

If this is your case, you can change the threshold or other settings from the Image Trace panel.

**Step 4**: Click the icon next to the preset to open the Image Trace panel.

**Step 5**: Move the slider to change the threshold until youâ€™re happy with the silhouette.

Check the **Preview** box on the bottom-left corner to see how your silhouette looks while changing.

### Method 2: Pen Tool 

If you are making a simple silhouette shape without many details, you can use the Pen Tool to quickly create an outline, and fill it with black.

Letâ€™s look at an example of how to make a silhouette of this cutie cat in Adobe Illustrator.

**Step 1**: Place the image in Illustrator.

**Step 2**: Select the **Pen Tool** from the toolbar or use the Pen Tool keyboard shortcut **<kbd>P</kbd>** key to activate the tool.

**Step 3**: Use the Pen Tool to outline the cat. Zoom in to draw for better precision.

**Step 4**: Remember to close the pen tool path.

**Step 5**: Now you have the outline. Just change the color to black and youâ€™re all set ðŸ™‚
