## 1. How to Create a New Document and Set Up the Background

### Step 1

Hit **Control-N** to create a new document. Select **Pixels** from the **Units** drop-down menu and enter **3000** in the width and height boxes. Select **RGB** for the **Color Mode**, set the **Resolution** to **72 Pixel/Inch**, and then click the **Create** button. Now that you’re set, let’s start the work on the Photoshop effect for text in flowers.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![new document](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/158/posts/36496/image-upload/FloralTypography1.jpg)</figure></div>Advertisement

### Step 2

Focus on the **Layers** panel (**Window &gt; Layers**) to unlock your starting layer, and then click the **Create a New Layer** button to add a second layer.

Pick the **Paint Bucket Tool (G)** from your toolbar, make sure that the foreground color is set to black (**R=0 G=0 B=0**), and simply click on your canvas to fill your new layer with black.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![new layer](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/158/posts/36496/image-upload/FloralTypography2.jpg)</figure></div>## 2. How to Set Up the Flower Photo

### Step 1

Keep focusing on the **Layers** panel and drag your white layer on top of the black layer.

Download this [flower bouquet photo](https://elements.envato.com/flower-bouquet-5H4V2JZ) from Envato Elements and simply drag it inside your document.

Return to the **Layers** panel, select your photo along with the white layer, **right-click** on one of these two elements, and go to **Merge Layers**.

**Double-click** the name of your black layer and rename it *‘Background’*, and then select the other layer and rename it *‘Flowers’*.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![add flower photo](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/158/posts/36496/image-upload/FloralTypography3.jpg)</figure></div>Advertisement

### Step 2

Make sure that your *‘Flowers’* layer is still selected and select the **Magic Wand (W)** tool from your toolbar.

Focus on the control panel, set the **Tolerance** to **10** and uncheck the **Contiguous** box, and then simply click somewhere on the background from your *‘Flowers’* layer. This will add a selection around all the white content from your selected layer.

Return to the **Layers** panel, hold down the **Alt** key, and press the **Add layer mask** button to mask the content that you have selected.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![mask flower layer](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/158/posts/36496/image-upload/FloralTypography4.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 3

Ensure that the layer mask applied to your *‘Flowers’* layer stays selected, and focus on your design. If you look closer at the flowers, you’ll notice that some sections from the white flowers are masked.

Let’s fix this using the **Brush Tool (B)**. Set the foreground color to white (**R=255 G=255 B=255**) and **right-click** on your canvas to select a hard round brush tip, adjusting the size or the hardness of the brush as needed.

Simply paint over the areas that should be visible, and keep in mind that you can also use the **\[** and **\]** keys to easily increase or decrease the brush size.

If there are any parts that you want to unpaint, you need to set the foreground color to black and unpaint those areas. Use the **X** key to swap the foreground and background colors easily.

### Step 1

Pick the **Type Tool (T)** from your toolbar and focus on the **Character** panel (**Window &gt; Character**).

Select the [Big John font](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FJFJ4Xvv2NK_J-od47p-LAT3VJaXa0ry), set the size to **500**, the leading to **400**, and the tracking to **150**, change the color to white, and click on your canvas. Type in *‘FLORAL’* on three separate rows and switch to the **Move Tool (V)**.

Press **Control-A** to create a selection around your entire canvas, and click the **Align horizontal center** and **Align vertical center** buttons from the control panel to easily move your text to the center of the canvas. Once you’re done, press **Control-D** to eliminate the selection around the canvas.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![flower text effect](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/158/posts/36496/image-upload/FloralTypography6.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

Focus on the **Layers** panel, make sure that the text is still selected, and lower its **Opacity** to **50%**. This will make it easier to paint the floral parts on top of the text in the following steps.

### Step 1

Select your *‘Flowers’* layer and press **Control-J** to duplicate it. Drag this new layer to the top of the **Layers** panel and select the applied layer mask.

Switch to the **Brush Tool (B)** and set the foreground color to white. Make sure that the mask applied to the *‘Flowers copy’* layer is still selected, and then start painting over the parts you want to have in front of the text. Take your time to paint these parts as precisely as possible, and don’t forget that you can use the **\[** and **\]** keys to easily increase or decrease the brush size.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![flower text](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=850/uploads/users/158/posts/36496/image-upload/FloralTypography9.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 3

Hold down **Control** and click the layer mask applied on the *‘Flowers copy’* layer to load a selection around the mask.

Move to the **Layers** panel to add a new layer, name it *‘Shadow’* and select it. Grab the **Paint Bucket Tool (G)**, set the foreground color to black, and simply click inside your selection to fill it with black.

Press **Control-D** to get rid of that selection, and then press the down arrow key five times to move your selected layer **5 px** down.

Focus on the **Layers** panel and drag your *‘Shadow’* layer below the *‘Flowers copy’* layer.

**Right-click** on your *‘Shadow’* layer and go to **Convert to Smart Object**, and then go to **Filter &gt; Blur &gt; Gaussian Blur**. Set the **Radius** to **7 px** and click **OK**.

Focus on the **Layers** panel, hold **Control**, and click your text to load a selection around it.

With this selection active, select the *‘Shadow’* layer and just click the **Add layer mask** button.

Having a closer look between the *‘L’* and the *‘R’* from the text, you’ll notice a small overlap from the *‘Shadow’* layer.

To fix this small issue, make sure that the layer mask applied on the *‘Shadow’* layer is still selected, grab the **Brush Tool (B)** and set the foreground color to black, and then simply paint over that overlapping area to mask it.
