<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/14094505/how-to-use-the-pen-tool-1-1-2.png)</figure>You can use the pen tool to convert an object to something completely new, create awesome graphics, and so much more.

Use the pen tool to trace image/object outlines, create logos, make clipping masks, and design or edit vector graphics.

I have to admit that as easy as it sounds, it takes time to be good at it. I started to practice the pen tool tracing outlines, and I remember at first, it really took me a long time to trace. The hardest part is to use the Pen Tool to draw smooth lines.

## How to Use the Pen Tool in Adobe Illustrator

*Note: Screenshots are taken from the Illustrator CC Mac version. The Windows or other versions might look slightly different.*

The Pen Tool is all about anchor points. Any lines or shapes you create, you are connecting anchor points. You can draw straight lines or curve lines, and you can add or delete anchor points to make any shapes you like.

Select the **Pen Tool** from the toolbar (or use the keyboard shortcut **<kbd>P</kbd>**), and start creating!

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/14094506/how-to-use-the-pen-tool6-2.png)</figure>### Creating straight lines 

Itâ€™s super easy to create straight lines using the Pen Tool. Start creating by clicking on the artboard and releasing to make the first anchor point, which is also known as the original anchor point.

**Step 1**: Select the **Pen Tool** from the toolbar.

**Step 2**: Click and release on your artboard to create the first anchor point.

**Step 3**: Click and release to create another anchor point. Hold the **<kbd>Shift</kbd>** key when you click to create perfectly straight lines.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/14094508/how-to-use-the-pen-tool3-2.png)</figure>**Step 4**: Keep clicking and releasing to create paths until you get what you want.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/14094509/how-to-use-the-pen-tool5-2.png)</figure>**Step 5**: If you are creating a shape, youâ€™ll have to close the path by connecting the last anchor point to the original one. When you close the path, the ending point is filled black as you can see from the top left corner.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/14094510/how-to-use-the-pen-tool9-2.png)</figure>If you donâ€™t want to close the path, hit **<kbd>Esc</kbd>** or the **<kbd>Return</kbd>** key on your keyboard and the path will form. The last anchor point you create is the ending point of your path.

### Drawing curve lines 

Drawing curve lines can be more complicated but is really useful for making a clipping mask, shapes, [creating a silhouette](https://illustratorhow.com/how-to-make-silhouettes/), and basically any graphic design.

Get started by creating the first anchor point. When you curve the path, instead of just clicking and releasing, youâ€™ll have to click, drag to create a direction handle, and release to create a curve.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/14094512/how-to-use-the-pen-tool2-2.png)</figure>You can click on the handle and move around to adjust the curve. The more/further you drag, the bigger the curve is. But you can always edit the curve using the **Anchor Point Tool**.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/14094513/how-to-use-the-pen-tool8-2.png)</figure>With the path and the tool selected, click and drag on the anchor point to edit the curve, and release when you are satisfied with the curve.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/14094514/how-to-use-the-pen-tool10-2.png)</figure>You can use the Anchor Point Tool to edit on either a straight on curve path. For example, Iâ€™d like to curve a straight line.

Itâ€™s easier to get a nice curve when your anchor points are further from each other ðŸ˜‰*

### Adding/Deleting anchor points 

Click on the path where you want to add an anchor point, and you will see a small plus sign next to the pen, which means you are adding an anchor point.

**Step 1**: Select your path.

**Step 2**: Select the **Pen Tool**.

**Step 3**: Click on the path to add new anchor points.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/14094518/how-to-use-the-pen-tool11-2.png)</figure>To delete an anchor point, you need to have the pen tool selected, hover on the existing anchor point, and the pen tool will automatically change to **Delete Anchor Point Tool** (youâ€™ll see a little minus sign next to the pen tool), and just click on the anchor points that you want to delete.

Iâ€™ve just deleted a couple of anchor points from the shape above.

There are so many tools you can use to cut or ease the line to create a separate path in Adobe Illustrator. If itâ€™s just simply line/path, try the [Scissors tool](https://illustratorhow.com/how-to-use-scissors-tool/).

Click on path from one point to another where youâ€™ll want to cut, select the path, and you should be able to separate and move the paths.
