1\. **Aperture**

The opening at the end of an open counter.

2\. **Baseline**

![font-anatomy-3-by-inkydeals](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2016/01/27191340/font-anatomy-3-by-inkydeals.png)

As the legendary Les Claypool [puts it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5XeVLJeMdE "design resources") – “the baseline is the line upon which most letters “sit” and below which descenders extend. The vertical distance of the baselines of consecutive lines in a paragraph is also known as line height or leading, although the latter can also refer to the baseline distance minus the font size.

North Indian scripts have a characteristic hanging baseline; the letters are aligned to the top of the writing line, marked by an overbar, with diacritics extending above the baseline. East Asian scripts have no baseline; each glyph sits in a square box, with neither ascenders nor descenders. When mixed with scripts with a low baseline, East Asian characters should be set so that the bottom of the character is between the baseline and the descender height. “

3\. **Ascender**

![font-anatomy-4-by-inkydeals](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images/2016/01/27191339/font-anatomy-4-by-inkydeals.png)

Well, the ascender, in typography, expresses the mean line of a font. It makes the font more recognizable, more “warm” if you choose to put it like that.

4\. **Descender**

As opposed to the ascender, the descender is that part of the letter that goes below the x-height.

5\. **Uppercase**
