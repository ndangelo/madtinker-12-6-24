Infographics are a powerful tool to help marketers communicate, hence they’ve grown in popularity over the last decade. Why do they work so well? In addition to [helping your brain process content quicker,](https://www.columnfivemedia.com/why-your-brain-loves-visual-content-infographic) they’re visually appealing and highly shareable, which is why they come in handy for all sorts of applications, from presentations to content marketing. To us, however, a well-crafted infographic isn’t just a piece of content; it’s a thing of beauty. That’s why we’ve compiled some of our favorite infographic examples for your inspiration.

From how-tos to social issues, these infographics are awesome examples of how to do brand storytelling through a visual medium.[](https://www.columnfivemedia.com/resources/content-strategy-toolkit/)

## 9 of the Best Infographic Examples

Whether you’re looking for general design inspiration or a few fresh content ideas, here are some of our favorite infographics, plus a few tips on how to put infographics to work for you.

### **1) [A Well-Balanced Blog](https://www.columnfivemedia.com/work-items/infographic-a-well-balanced-blog) by LinkedIn**

As the market becomes saturated with infographics, finding unique and creative ways to rise above the noise is essential. This [LinkedIn](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/blog/t/the-blogging-food-groups-a-well-balanced-diet-of-content-infographic) infographic does just that in two ways.

First, it takes a thematic approach to the content. Rather than providing a matrix outlining when to post certain types of blog content, LinkedIn uses a visual metaphor to communicate the information. This helps make the subject matter more exciting and easier to understand.

Second, the use of photography is visually appealing. With photos of meats, vegetables, and grains, the infographic design takes on its own personality. What could be better? We’re left with a great resource that’s amazing to look at.

**Pro tip:** Take a cue from [LinkedIn](https://www.columnfivemedia.com/what-you-can-learn-linkedin-content-strategy) and mix up your design. It’s easy to get stuck in the same infographic style, but you don’t have to do the same thing over and over. From photography to line art, here are [7 different infographic styles to experiment with](https://www.columnfivemedia.com/7-infographic-design-styles-to-try).

### **2) [The Sound Of Color](https://www.columnfivemedia.com/work-items/infographic-the-sound-of-color-creating-a-color-palette-with-your-favorite-music) by Kelly-Moore Paints**

Choosing the right color is a challenge, whether you’re buying a new car or decorating your nursery. [Kelly-Moore Paints](http://kellymoore.com/color/sound-of-color) knows this, so they came up with a brilliant idea: Why not choose a color based on your favorite music? It’s a novel and fun way to showcase their color expertise, but best of all, it’s also a beautiful infographic.

More conceptual art piece than infographic, this piece turned favorite albums into colorful [data visualizations](https://www.columnfivemedia.com/data-basics-need-know) based on emotions experienced while listening to the music. The result is one of our infographic design examples.

You can’t have a roundup of [infographic design](https://www.columnfivemedia.com/11-best-practices-for-infographic-design-and-distribution) examples without featuring a map of some kind. (We’re pretty sure it might be a law.)

### **4) [Carbs Are Killing You](https://www.columnfivemedia.com/work-items/infographic-carbs-are-killing-you-eating-fat-doesnt-make-you-fat) by Massive Health**

We’ve all heard how curbing our fatty food consumption will help us lose weight. But according to this awesome infographic by [Massive Health](http://blog.massivehealth.com/), carbs (not fats) may really be to blame.

This infographic does an excellent job of walking the reader through a somewhat complex process, while still maintaining a single takeaway: Fats don’t make us fat; carbs do. What’s more, visual learners can stand up and applaud the clear illustration style that accompanies it.

### **6) [How Marketers Create and Consume Content](https://www.columnfivemedia.com/work-items/how-marketers-create-and-consume-content) by NewsCred**

Not all infographics have to be static. This [NewsCred](https://insights.newscred.com/how-marketers-create-and-consume-content/) infographic (or infoGIF) proves this, as it visualizes the brand’s survey findings in a creative way.

The data visualization is presented along with animated illustrations that reflect the survey question. Even better, the graphic was designed modularly, allowing it to be sliced up into stand-alone panels, which can be published in blog posts, on social, etc.![infographic-design-examples-newscred](https://columnfivemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Infographic-design-newscred-scaled.gif)

### **8) [A Lyrical Good Time](https://www.columnfivemedia.com/work-items/a-lyrical-good-time) by Digit**

Illustration can also be used well in infographics. For this infographic, financial company [Digit](https://digit.co/) had a unique concept: Tally up exactly how much a “good time” would cost, according to the lyrics of different songs.

The information is accompanied by detailed illustrations of all the trappings described in the songs, offering an entertaining (and slightly whimsical) presentation.

![infographic-design-examples](https://columnfivemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Infographic-design-examples.png)

**Pro tip:** Infographic inspiration can come from anywhere; what matters most is that it’s something that people will be interested in.

### **9) [Seeing Green](https://www.columnfivemedia.com/work-items/digit-seeing-green) by Digit**

The topic of marijuana legalization is nothing new, but the conversation has shifted in recent years, as laws relax in various states throughout the U.S.

Taking a more journalistic approach to join the conversation, the folks at Digit sought to examine shifting public opinion, new taxation policies, and how global economies function under legal marijuana status.

Naturally, the infographic design is also a driving force behind the popularity of this graphic. Its subtle use of texture, clear breakdown of sections, and overall sharp design show how to use a visual theme (e.g., weed) but not overpower the graphic.
